	<p>Salary negotiations follow a common pattern. Once I went through a few of them, I got the hang of it.</p>
	<p>In this interview, I tell Shaun Ley of BBC News what that pattern looks like and what you can expect when they negotiate your job offer.</p>

	<h2 class='u-center'>I'll show you how to negotiate your salary without leaving anything on the table</h2>
	<p>Your salary negotiation is important and there's a lot on the line. If your job offer is for $50,000, a 5% improvement is worth $2,500! And that's <em>before</em> negotiating non-salary benefits like vacation or a signing bonus.</p>
	
	<p>But you need to respond <em>now</em>—where do you start?</p>
	
	<p>My coaching clients use a step-by-step process to improve their job offers by an average of 8%. You can learn that same process in less than 90 minutes.</p>
