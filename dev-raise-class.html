	<p>Software developers are very valuable right now, but you don't know if <em>you</em> are paid what you're worth. You don't even know where to start and you don't have time to worry about it because you're always chasing the next release date.</p>

	<h2>With just a few hours of work, you could be asking for a raise in 30 days</h2>
	<p>The <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> process for getting a raise is simple, and you can <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-at-work/">get it for free</a>. But <em>knowing</em> the process and <em>doing</em> the process are two different things. If you just keep putting it off and waiting until later, you may never follow through.</p>
	<p>If you could get a $5,000 raise, but you wait six months, then you will be leaving $2,500 on the table.</p>
	<h2>The September class will be a beta, offered at a reduced cost of $250</h2>
	<p>Hundreds of people have read <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> and taken the video courses. And this is the first time the process to ask for a raise will be delivered in this format. That means I'll be refining the process and learning what works for you as we go.</p>
	<p><strong>So I'm offering this first class at a discounted price of $250 per person.</strong></p>
