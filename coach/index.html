	  <p><strong>You're on the clock.</strong> You finally got a job offer from a company you would like to work with, and they want to know if you're ready to accept it.</p>
		<p>You <em>think</em> you can command a higher salary and a better compensation package, but you just don't know how to negotiate these things in your job offer.</p>
	  <p>How do you counter their job offer? What if you ask for too much? What if you leave money on the table by asking for too little? What if they retract the job offer? <strong>How do you know <em>what to do</em> and <em>if you're doing it correctly</em>?</strong></p>
	
		<h2 class='u-center'>Wouldn't it be nice if someone else could just negotiate for you?</h2>

Software Developers at Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Zillow, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft, and other companies you've heard of have benefited from my full-service salary negotiation coaching.</p>
		<p><strong>How does this work?</strong> When you work with me, you'll have me working behind the scenes to negotiate your salary for you. You can rest assured you won't leave any compensation—monetary or non-monetary—on the table.</p>
		
		{% include testimonials/j_b.html %}
		<br>
	
		<h2 class='u-center'>“How much does this cost?”</h2>
	
		<p><strong>Salary negotiation coaching is an investment in your future.</strong> For every additional $10,000 in total compensation that you negotiate <em>today</em>, that will return an additional $100,000, $200,000, or even $500,000+ in income during your career.</p>
	
		<p>Salary negotiation coaching costs $3,000 plus 10% of any improvements we make to your first-year compensation. That's a <strong>service fee</strong> plus a <strong>result fee</strong>.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a summary of the salary negotiation coaching fee structure:</p>
	
		<table><tbody class='u-center'>
			<tr><th>Salary Negotiation Fee</th><th>Result Fee</th></tr>
			<tr><td><strong>$3,000</strong> to get started</td><td><strong>10% </strong>of the improvement to first-year compensation</td></tr>
		</tbody></table>
		
		<h3>Service fee</h3>
		
		<p>The $3,000 service fee is for all aspects of your salary negotiation. It ensures that I can provide the best quality service for every client.</p>
		
		<h3>Result fee</h3>
		
		<p>The result fee is due only when we improve your job offer, and is 10% of the improvement to your first-year compensation that we negotiate.</p>
		
		<p>The result fee is to ensure that our incentives are aligned throughout our engagement and to help us both share directly in the results. Sometimes, a company is very flexible and will significantly improve their offer through negotiation. Sometimes they are inflexible and their first offer is also their best offer. We cannot know which case applies to your offer until we negotiate, and the result fee enables us to work together knowing that we will share in the result.</p>
		
		<p>You keep 90% of the negotiated first-year compensation improvement, and I collect the remaining 10%.</p>

		<p>As soon as your service fee payment is received, we'll get started by scheduling your kickoff call. During this call, we will discuss your specific situation in detail and lay out our strategy for negotiating your offer.</p>
	
		<p>I'll negotiate your salary behind the scenes, consulting with you every step of the way to provide the best strategy to negotiate the best version of your job offer.</p> 
		
		<p>Once we conclude our engagement, we will calculate the result fee—10% of the improvement in your first-year compensation—and arrange payment.</p>

		<h2 class='u-center'>Jonathan turned disappointing offers from Amazon and Tesla into an additional $80,000 compensation at Tesla</h2>

		<p>Jonathan was a Senior Software Engineer with lots of experience working for big-time tech companies. He was ready for a change, so he applied for Senior engineering roles at Amazon and Tesla. He quickly got two job offers, but they were both very disappointing.</p>

		<p>He reached out and asked if I could help.</p>

		<p>Since the offers were both disappointing, I recommended that we get Amazon and Tesla to improve the offers before we began negotiating. If they would improve the offers from 'disappointing' to 'negotiable', then we could go to work.</p>

		<p>After a few days, both companies came back to Jonathan with significantly better offers. Now we had room to work!</p>

		<h3>Negotiating total compensation with base salary and RSUs in play</h3>

		<p>One tricky aspect of each offer was that they were very heavily focused on RSUs—Restricted Stock Units—which is common for public tech companies. Amazon caps base salary for most employees, and they offer RSUs as their primary negotiation lever once that base salary cap is reached.</p>

		<p>RSUs can potentially be very valuable, but it's difficult to impute a present value on them in order to compare the value of the RSUs to, say, base salary or a signing bonus.</p>

		<p>Through a careful analysis of the job offer and current market conditions, I was able to estimate the present value of the RSUs and help Jonathan negotiate on the two dimensions he cared most about: his base salary and RSUs.</p>

		<h3>Choosing between two good options</h3>

		<p>We were able to significantly improve both of Jonathan's job offers from Amazon and Tesla so that he had a difficult decision to make.</p>

		<p>With the hard work of negotiating behind us, we turned our focus to comparing the two opportunities on several dimensions to help Jonathan determine which opportunity was right for him.</p>

		<p>In the end, he chose Tesla for the work environment, greater opportunity to work on new technology and manage a team, and better compensation.</p>
	
		<p>By investing in salary negotiation coaching, Jonathan was able to improve his first-year compensation by $80,000.</p>
	
		<p>Here's what Jonathan had to say about the experience of working together:</p>

		<h2 class='u-center'>Salary negotiation coaching isn't for everyone, here's how to determine if this is right for you...</h2>
		<p><strong>Q: I've never negotiated before. Will this coaching work for me?</strong></p>
		<p><strong>A: Yes!</strong> You don't need to be an experienced negotiator to benefit from negotiating your salary. With this salary negotiation coaching, you'll be totally prepared for every conversation, and even have word-for-word scripts to use every step of the salary negotiation process.</p>
		<hr>
	
		<p><strong>Q: I'm not a Software Developer. Can you help me?</strong></p>
		<p><strong>A:</strong> I can definitely help, although 1-on-1 coaching may not be your best option depending on your budget and timeline.</p>
		<p>Please complete <a href="/coach/apply/negotiate/">this application</a> and I'll schedule a free 15-minute call to suggest the best option for you.</p>
		<hr>
	
		<p><strong>Q: What if I'm not happy with the results? Can I get my money back?</strong></p>
		<p><strong>A:</strong> Until our kickoff meeting, you can request a refund of your service fee at any time for any reason. Once we have completed our kickoff call, the engagement is underway and refunds are not available.</p>
		<p>And the result fee is designed so that we share in the result, regardless of the outcome. There will only be a result fee if we improve your offer.</p>

		<p>It's time to decide: Are you ready to get paid what you're worth so you can finally afford those things you've been putting off? This is your chance to finally make the downpayment on that house or plan the family vacation you've been dreaming of.</p>
		<p>On average, Software Developers I work with improve their job offers by {{ site.avg_coach_increase_devs }}. And other professionals—marketers, coding school instructors, and others—improve their job offers by {{ site.avg_coach_increase_non_devs }}.</p>
		<p><strong>If you're ready to invest in yourself, this is your chance to avoid leaving money on the table.</strong></p>
		<p>Salary negotiation coaching works. The testimonials and results from other Software Developers are the outcomes we're aiming for when we work together to negotiate your salary and help you get paid what you're worth worth.</p>
		<p>You don't get many opportunities to change jobs and negotiate a significantly higher salary. Don't miss out on your chance to negotiate a higher salary at your next job.</p>
