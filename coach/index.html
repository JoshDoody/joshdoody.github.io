      <p>You have a great opportunity at a great new company, and your first interview is coming up. Hooray! But you realize that you’re not prepared for the interview and you don’t have much time to fix that.</p>
			<p>Here are just a few of the things that are probably occurring to you right now:</p>
      <ul class="question-list">
				<li class="question-list__item">What do I say when they ask about my salary requirements?</li>
				<li class="question-list__item">How can I stand out from other candidates?</li>
				<li class="question-list__item">Should I negotiate starting salary if they make me an offer?</li>
				<li class="question-list__item">How?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There’s a lot on the line and you know you should prepare so you don’t squander this opportunity, but you don’t have time to read a book or take a course. What can you do?</p>
			<p>There are simple tactics you can use to ace your interviews and confidently negotiate your starting salary. I’ve used them myself to get great job offers and negotiate my own salary. I’ve many helped others use them to do the same.</p>
			<p>If you could negotiate a $5,000 increase in your starting salary, you would make $5,000 more that first year. And you would make $5,000 the next year, and the next year, and the next year. Over 20 years, that $5,000 salary increase would be worth more than $100,000.</p>

			<p>When you work with me, you’ll know exactly what to expect every step of the way, and you’ll have a clear plan to follow.</p>
			<p>Here is how I can help you:</p>
			<ul>

				<li>Avoid common mistakes that could cost you thousands of dollars in your interviews and starting salary negotiation.</li>
				<li>Prepare a plan for every phase of your starting salary negotiation so you
maximize your starting salary and other benefits.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Juggling multiple job offers? I can help you get the best job available and maximize your starting salary while we’re at it.</p>

			<p><strong>What if I can’t afford this?</strong> You can do this on your own with my book and courses. The difference is that it will take you more time and I won’t be able to offer specific suggestions for your unique situation. But hundreds of people have read my book and taken my courses and gotten phenomenal results.</p>
			<p><strong>Will I really be working directly with you?</strong> Yes. We’ll work together 1-on-1 so that I can understand your unique situation and walk you through the entire process. I’ll give you some light homework, and we’ll touch base after every phase of the process to get you the best possible result. Here’s an example:</p>

		<div class="container container--normal">		
			<p><strong>How do I know this will even work?</strong> Don’t take my word for it. Read the testimonials from other happy customers and see for yourself.</p>
			<p><strong>Can I get my money back if it doesn’t work?</strong> No, and here’s why: You’re buying my time and expertise, not a tangible product that you can return. I’m investing my time in the same way you’re investing your money. I am just as motivated to get you the best result as you are. Since I can’t get my time back, I can’t give your money back. If you’re not comfortable with this, then my book and courses may be better for you—they come with a 30-day money back guarantee when you buy them through this site.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="container container--normal">	
      <p>First, you’ll set up an account so we can work together. You’ll give me your payment information and then I will send you a short survey to learn more about your situation and how I can help you, and you’ll get a link to schedule time for our first meeting.</p>
			<p>Before our first meeting, I’ll review your survey results to make sure I can help you. Once I confirm I can help you, then we’ll have our first meeting where I’ll ask you a few more questions and then we'll jump straight into planning for the next phase of your process. If you have interviews coming up, we’ll make sure you’re prepared and you know how to stand out and avoid costly mistakes. If you have a negotiation coming up, we’ll plan for your negotiation to maximize your starting salary and benefits.</p>
			<p>I’ll follow up after our calls with an email summary including action items and next steps for easy reference. I’ll make sure you know how much time we’re using so there aren’t any surprises.</p>
			<p>We’ll either keep working through email or schedule another call if that will be faster. Once you’re through with your interviews and negotiation, I’ll bill your credit card for the time we worked together.</p>
			<p>Then I’ll ask you if you’re comfortable sharing a testimonial about your fantastic result :)</p>

I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. <strong>I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>
			            <p>With the experience and confidence I gained from doubling my own salary, I began helping others make thousands more dollars as well. You can read their stories on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials" target="_blank">testimonials page</a>.</p>
			            <p>I took everything I learned from my own experience and helping others and wrote <strong><em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, a #1 Best Seller on Amazon</strong>. My book, courses and 1-on-1 coaching have helped many people earn tens of thousands more dollars.</p>
			<p>The best results have come from my coaching clients, and I really like working with people 1-on-1 to tailor my interviewing and salary negotiation strategy to their specific situation. My clients have had amazing results.</p>
