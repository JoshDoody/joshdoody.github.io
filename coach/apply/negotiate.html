	<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. <strong>I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>
	<p>Now I use everything I learned from my own experience to help others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with companies like <strong>Google, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM</strong>, and other companies you've probably heard of.</p>
