I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. **I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.**

With the experience and confidence I gained from doubling my own salary, I began helping others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with companies like **Google, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM**, and many other companies you've probably heard of.

I love finding new audiences to talk with through interviews, guest posts, and talks. This page is a good summary of other places where you can find my work.
