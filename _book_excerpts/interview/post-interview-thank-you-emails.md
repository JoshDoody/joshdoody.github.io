Now you’ve aced the Interview, but your work isn’t done yet—you still have a few more opportunities to stand out in the post-interview.

First, if you happen to have your interviewer's email address (we're calling him Andy), shoot him a very, very short email thanking him for his time. You’ll also want to discretely share your contact information just in case he needs it later. Unless there’s something specific he expects you to follow up on, don’t ask any new questions or give Andy any action items in this email. This is just a short email to say "Thanks!" and demonstrate professionalism; it shouldn’t require a response.

<p>Hi Andy</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thanks for your time today. It was great to learn more about ACME Corp, and about the Associate Accountant role in particular. ACME Corp sounds like a great company to work for!</p>
<p>Feel free to email or call anytime if you have any follow-up questions.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time and have a great day!</p>

<p>All the best</p>

You’ll also want to send an email to the recruiter if that person and Andy are different people. There’s one wrinkle here: If you *don’t* have Andy’s contact information, you’ll want to ask the recruiter thank him for you and let him know that you appreciated his time.
