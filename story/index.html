			<p>You should listen to Josh! He knows what he's talking about ;)</p>
				
			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Your career is a story</h2>
			
			<p>Your story will look a lot like others' stories, but yours will be different because you'll make a lot more money for doing the same work you would have done anyway.</p>

			<p>How?</p>

			<p>You'll take advantage of <em class='u-highlight'>five opportunities to negotiate a higher salary</em>. The best part? Those five opportunities will come up over and over again throughout your career! So once you know how to take advantage of them, you can do the same thing over and over again and make more money every time.</p>

			<p>Jared Allen made another $8,000 in base salary becuase he took advnatage of these opportunities. That's $8,000 extra <em>every year</em>. Five years from now, Jared will have an extra $40,000 in his pocket because he negotiated his salary.</p>

			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Opportunity 1: The Dreaded Salary Question</h2>
	
			<p>Your first opportunity to make a lot ore money is unusual because you'll take advantage of it by <em>not</em> doing something that could cost you a lot of money.</p>

			<p>I call it <em>The Dreaded Salary Question</em>, and it usually comes up early in the interview process, sometimes before you even start interviewing. It looks like this:</p>
			
		</div>

    <blockquote class="quote">
      <div class="container container--widened">
        <p class="quote__text">So where are you right now in terms of compensation, and what are you hoping for if you make this move?</p>
        <cite class="quote__byline">Recruiter or Hiring Manager, early in the interivew process</cite>
      </div>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="container container--normal">

			<p>Sound familiar? I bet it does.</p>

			<p><em class='u-highlight'>You shouldn't disclose your current or desired salary in a negotation</em>—it will cost you money if you do. Don't squander this opportunity by disclosing your current or desired salary.</p>
			
			<p>John didn't disclose his current or desired salaries, and look how it worked out for him...</p>
			
		</div>

    <div class="container container--normal">

			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Opportunity 2: Counteroffer</h2>
			
			<p>If you do well in your interviews, you'll get a job offer. Your next opportunity to make a lot more money is how you respond to that job offer: <em class='u-highlight'>if you negotiate, you'll make a lot more money over the course of your career</em>; if you just accept the job offer, you'll cost yourself a lot of money.</p>

			<p>Justin almost passed on this opportunity, but he didn't! Instead, he took advantage of this opportunity and made $11,000 more last year.</p>   
		</div>
		
 		{% include testimonials/justin_abrahms.html %}
		
    <div class="container container--normal">
		
			<p>So when you get a job offer, <em class='u-highlight'>you should counter somehwere between 10% and 20% above that offer</em>. If you do this, you will make a lot more money throughout your career.</p>
			
			<p>Shannon also countered and look how well she did!</p>
			
		</div>
		
		{% include testimonials/shannon_long.html %}
		
    <div class="container container--normal">
			
			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Opportunity 3: The Final Discussion</h2>

			<p>Even if you counteroffer, you're not done negotiating! There's still another opportunity to make a bit more money before you finalize things!</p> 

			<p>They'll usually come back to you with some sort of compromise—something less than your counter and more than their initial offer. I call this <em>The Final Discussion</em>.</p>
			
			<p><em class='u-highlight'>This is a chance for you to keep negotiating for a little more base salary and other benefits like extra vacation, a signing bonus, or even work from home a couple days a week.</em></p> 

			<p>Josh C. did a great job negotiating a big salary increase, but he didn't stop there! He also got an extra week of vacation each year...</p>

			<h2 class='section-heading'>What about when you're staying put?</h2>

			<p>There are two great opportunities to make more money at your current job. One pays off later, and the other pays off immediately.</p>
			
			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Opportunity 4: Getting promoted</h2>

			<p>Most people sit back and wait for promotions to come to them. But you won't do that because you want to progress as quickly as possible so you have more experience and a greater opportunity to get paid.</p>

			<p><em class='u-highlight'>You'll actively pursue your next promotion</em>, then your next one, and your next one so that you're always moving forward. You'll get more promotions and make more money that way.</p>
			
			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Opportunity 5: Getting a raise</h2>

			<p>Just like promotions, most people sit back and wait for raises to come to them. They wait for merit increases or market adjustments to be granted by HR istead of just going after them.</p>

			<p><em class='u-highlight'>You'll actively pursue raises so that you're always paid what you're worth and recognized for all the value you add to your company.</em> All you need to do is occasionally do some market research so you know your market value, and keep track of all the new skills and experience you contribute to your company as you add more and more value.</p>

			<p>Mike G. stopped waiting for his next raise and look how well it worked out...</p>
		
		</div>
		
 		{% include testimonials/mike_g.html %}
		
    <div class="container container--normal">
		
			<p>Not bad, right? What Mike didn't tell you was the whole process was super easy. And he gets $13,000 more this year, and next year, and the next. Not a bad use of his time!</p>

			<h2 class='section-heading header--centered'>Summary: 5 opportunities to make a lot more money</h2>
