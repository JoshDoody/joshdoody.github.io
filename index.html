  <p><strong>Salary negotiation can be intimidating.</strong> There’s a lot on the line and every situation is unique. Plus, there are so many questions that it can feel overwhelming.</p>

	<p>Should you negotiate your starting salary? Is it possible to get a win-win result without leaving anything on the table?</p>
	<p>How much should you counter offer? <em>How</em> do you counter offer? When?</p>
	<p>What if the company retracts your job offer because you negotiate?</p>
	<p>Should you disclose your salary requirements during your job interviews? How do you know what to say in your interviews?</p>
	<p>How do you ask for a raise? <em>When</em> should you ask for a raise? What salary should you ask for?</p>

	<p>It can be easy to just throw your hands up in frustration and skip the salary negotiation altogether, but then <strong>you could be leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table</strong>.</p>

	<h2>The most common salary negotiation mistake? Not negotiating at all.</h2>
	<p>Ashley was interviewing for a new consulting opportunity at a software company. Her old company was going through a significant reorganization, and she was looking for a new opportunity in a more stable working environment. <strong>She was even willing to accept a lateral move in pay</strong> to get out of the old company and into a new one. She wasn't planning to negotiate if they made her an offer that matched her current salary.</p>
	<p>We scheduled a time to talk and I asked her some questions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>"What is your market value?"</strong> Quite a bit higher than her current pay.</li>
		<li><strong>"How do you stack up against other consultants in your industry?"</strong> She was one of the most experienced consultants in the industry.</li>
		<li><strong>"How badly does this new company need your expertise?"</strong> They desperately needed her specific skillset and experience.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>She was in a very strong negotiating position, but didn't even plan to negotiate if they could meet her current salary! With a little bit of coaching, she decided to negotiate rather than accepting a lateral move. The result? <strong>She made an additional $15,000 in base salary by negotiating her job offer.</strong></p>

	<h2>This simple method will earn you thousands of dollars</h2>
	<p>The best part? You can use this method <em>over and over</em> throughout your career when you change jobs <em>and</em> you can use it at your current job. It's easy and repeatable.</p>
	<p>If you could negotiate a $5,000 increase, you would make $5,000 more that first year. And you would make $5,000 the next year, and the next year, and the next year. <strong>Over 20 years, that $5,000 salary increase would be worth more than $100,000.</strong> That’s a lot of money to leave on the table out of frustration or fear.</p>

	<p><strong>What if I don’t need <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> right now?</strong></p>
	<p>Remember that example above where you negotiated $5,000 more in base salary and that added up to more than $100,000 over the next 20 years of your career? If you wait just one year, then that same $5,000 is only worth $95,000 over the next 20 years. Wait two years and that same $5,000 increase is only worth $90,000 over the next 20 years. <strong>The sooner you start getting paid what you're worth, the more money you will make over the course of your career.</strong></p>
	
	<p><strong>I don’t have time for this right now.</strong></p>
	<p>That’s not a question! But I’ll answer it anyway. ;) <strong>You can read <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> cover to cover in about 4 hours on a Sunday afternoon.</strong> I'll even send you short emails with one key takeaway from each chapter so you get the highlights if you can't start reading right away. The courses are about three hours total, so you could easily knock those out on Sunday afternoon. I don’t like fluff, so <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> is a lean guide full of tactics and light on fluff.</p>
