I'm [Josh Doody](/josh-doody/), and *Fearless Salary Negotiation* is my way of helping others understand their value and use collaborative strategies and tactics to finally get paid what they're worth.

It began as [a book](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Salary-Negotiation-step-step/dp/0692568689) that quickly became a #1 Best Seller on Amazon. As I coached software developers and other professionals through their salary negotiations, I continued building this site to share everything I know about salary negotiation so others can benefit as well.

*Fearless Salary Negotiation* is now recognized as a go-to resource by the [media](/media-appearances/) and [customers](/testimonials/) alike. The book and courses have been used by thousands of people to earn millions of dollars that they otherwise would have left on the table.
