			</p>
			<p>Hi Brittany</p>
			<p>I hope you had a great weekend!</p>
			<p>I've been considering Tom’s offer over the weekend and everything sounds good, although I would like to discuss the base salary component.</p>
			<p>I think I'm a particularly good match for this position, where I would add significant value to ACME Corp. and to the Tom’s Practice from Day One. I have a strong technical background and have built and managed teams of technical people. I am exceptionally good with clients, and have taught short courses on building rapport with and managing clients. I have an MBA and have successfully managed many portfolios of business in the Widget Making industry over the past seven years. I've been working with [Partner Company] for over two and a half years, and have experience with many of their partnership managers and leadership team. I have a strong technical writing background and can both create and delegate the creation of good collateral quickly and efficiently. </p>
			<p>All of these qualities contribute directly to the core components of this particular position, and that's why I'm excited for the opportunity to work with Tom and his Practice in this capacity at ACME Corp.</p>
			<p>Tom offered $50,000 and I would be more comfortable if we could settle on $56,000. I feel that amount reflects the importance and expectations of the position for ACME Corp’s business, and my qualifications and experience as they relate to this particular position. </p>
			<p>Thanks for your time, and I look forward to talking with you on Monday morning at 10:30 ET!</p>
			<p>All the best</p>

      <h2>This is a real email I sent during a salary negotiation</h2>
			<p>I've changed the names and numbers, but this salary negotiation email sample is based on a real email I sent to negotiate starting salary. Here are the steps I took after receiving a verbal job offer from the hiring manager:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I asked for a couple days to consider the job offer</li>
				<li>I calculated my counter offer</li>
				<li>I reviewed the job offer and my own qualifications</li>
				<li>I composed this email</li>
				<li>I sent this email to the internal recruiter I was working with and copied the recruiter's manager, who I had also been working with</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And that's how I used this salary negotiation email sample to negotiate starting salary at a recent job. (If you're curious, these numbers are to scale, and we ended up around $55,000.)</p>
			<p>This is an excerpt from <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> and you can download the entire chapter below!</p>
			<p>Feel free to use this salary negotiation email sample in your own salary negotiation!</p>
			<p>All the best</p>
			<p>– Josh</p>
