    <p><strong>You should negotiate starting salary</strong> rather than just accepting the first job offer you get. Why?</p>
		<p>If you negotiate a $5,000 increase, you will make $5,000 more the first year at your new job. And you will make $5,000 the next year, and the next year, and the next year. <strong>Over 20 years, that $5,000 salary increase would be worth more than $100,000.</strong> Negotiating starting salary at a new company is one of the best opportunities to get this sort of increase or even more.</p>

    <p><strong>Now that you have your counteroffer calculated, you need to deliver it to the recruiter or hiring manager.</p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="container container--grid">

    <p><strong>If possible, deliver your counteroffer in an email.</strong> Why? So that you can also make your case to justify your counteroffer and so your written case can be circulated internally at the company if they need to discuss it.</p>

    <h2 class='section-heading section-heading--with-line'>3. Prepare for your final discussion</h2>
    <p><strong>Once you've countered, the company will probably respond with something between your job offer and your counteroffer.</strong> That's your salary negotiation window. Your goal is to maximize your salary within that window.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container container--grid">

    <p>Let's say the company has made <em class='u-highlight'>a job offer of <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span></em>, and <em class='u-highlight'>your counteroffer is <span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>. <em class='u-highlight'>Your negotiation window is now <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span>–<span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>.</p>
				
		<p>Break your salary negotiation window into increments. Each increment represents a possible response the company might make to your counteroffer.</p>
			
		<p>For each increment, plan <em>your</em> response. First, you'll work to maximize your starting salary. <em class='u-highlight'>Your minimum acceptable salary is <span class='minimum-acceptable'>$52,000</span>, so you will not take the job for less than that amount.</em></p>
			
		<p>Once you've maximized your starting salary, then pursue additional benefits that are important to you, starting with the most important benefit.</p>
