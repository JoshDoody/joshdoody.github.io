title: Salary negotiation for engineers, developers, and designers
excerpt: A Salary Negotiation Workshop for software engineers and designers, given for the Orlando Devs Meetup and The Iron Yard Orlando campus.
---

I recently did a Salary Negotiation workshop for the [Orlando Devs Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OrlandoDevs/) and [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/)'s Orlando campus. It was a great opportunity to work with software engineers and designers, who are simultaneously in _very_ high demand right now, and hesitant to negotiate their salary. 

My talk was about 30 minutes, starting with a salary negotiation overview for those who are looking to change jobs—how to prepare for your interviews, and how to negotiate your starting salary. Then I switched gears to talk about how to get your next raise or promotion for those who are planning to stay put. 

After the talk, we did about 40 minutes of Q&A, which I thought was really fun and enlightening. 

Here’s the full talk. And below that is an outline that shows all the topics we discussed, and a list of all the questions that were asked so you can jump right to something if you’re interested.
