excerpt: Salary negotiation can be intimidating. So here are 8 reasons you should NOT negotiate your salary.

There are *tons* of articles about why you *should* negotiate your salary, and the world needs more contrarian takes. So here are 8 reasons you should NOT negotiate your salary.

## 1. The company will retract your job offer

The idea is that you applied, went through a number of interviews, finally got a job offer, and then asked for more than they offered. And they're so offended that you would DARE counter offer that they just walk away and tell you the deal is off.

This doesn't happen in the real world. Just as you've invested time and energy throughout the interview process, the company has invested its own resources. It's *expensive* to interview people. And they're not just going to throw all that effort away because you counter offered. Worst-case, they'll say, "Our offer is firm.", but even that's pretty rare. Best case, they'll accept your counter offer. More likely, they'll work with you to end up somewhere between their offer and your counter.

Shoot. Ok, let's try another one.

## 2. You will look greedy

They make you a decent offer, and you counter offer, so they think, "Ugh. Why are they being so greedy? I don't think we can work with someone who won't just accept a good job offer."

They could say that! But it's more likely that their offer wasn't their *best* offer and they left some wiggle room just in case you negotiate. And they make actually respect you *more* when you negotiate because it shows that you're a business-savvy professional who knows how to maximize value. Chances are their business depends on employees finding ways to maximize value to the business, so this could actually be a very positive trait for them.

Hm. Let's try another.

## 3. You'll start off on the wrong foot

You will often be in the uncomfortable position of negotiating your salary with your future boss. You don't want to be *adversaries* with your boss - you want to be *friends*! That way, your relationship is strong to begin with and it will be easy to work together.

But *is it* an adversarial thing to negotiate your salary? Your future boss probably doesn't think so because they probably make offers and negotiate salaries all the time. You certainly wouldn't be the first person to negotiate your starting salary when they made an offer. So they probably see salary negotiations as a normal part of the hiring process. You mgiht see it as adversarial, but that's most likely because it's not something you do very often, so it feels uncomfortable.

Chances are you'll endure a little discomfort, negotiate a better salary for yourself, and then join a team that invested in you by spending time in the interview process and working with you on your salary requirements.

This isn't going very well, but we'll find something eventually!

## 4. Money isn't important - it's all about the job

This is a good one: Money isn't the most important thing. I think we can all agree on that. So we're done here, right?

Weeeelllll, maybe not quite. The thing is the reason the company can pay you *any* salary is they're in business to make money. So money is actually probably very important to them. Maybe not *the most important thing*, but it's pretty high up there since money enables the business to continue existing and hiring people.

And it's not like you're going to show up to work every single day asking about money money money. In fact, focusing on money now, when you're negotiating the terms of your employment, will probably keep you from having to think about money *at all* for quite a while since you'll know you negotiated the best starting salary you could. You won't have to constantly wonder whether you are underpaid because you made the noble choice to ignore money and just accept the job.

Ah! I'm really sorry about this. I'm trying really hard to give you reasons you SHOULDN'T negotiate your salary and I'm failing miserably. Ok, let me try again. I can do better!

## 5. You don't know what you're worth

This is probably true for most people and it's a legitimate concern. How can you negotiate your salary if you don't even know what you're worth? You might know about what you're worth in your industry or even in your region, but you can't possibly know what you're worth *at this company*. They probably know a lot more about that than you do, so why not just let them *tell you* what they think you're worth and accept that valuation?

That's pretty sound logic. But! Not knowing your worth could actually be even *more* reason to negotiate since you can learn more about what you're worth to the company by negotiating. Like, what if the salary they offer you isn't actually what they think you're worth? Then your strategy of just accepting the offer doesn't tell you anything new. But by negotiating, you could make more money *and* learn more about the current value of your skillset and experience.

I almost had one!

## 6. You're happy with the offer

Right! If you like the offer, there's no reason to negotiate. Just accept the offer and move on.

Well, unless you underestimate your value. It's possible you're happy with the offer just because you don't have enough information yet. But what if you start working and find out someone else with a similar background to yours is making a lot more money? That could be pretty frustrating and you might not be as happy anymore.

Now we're right back to #5! Drat!

## 7. You'll get your foot in the door and THEN ask for a raise

This is a pretty good plan and it helps with a lot of these other items. No awkwardness, you don't need to know what you're worth, you won't seem greedy. So we're all set!

Well, except that most companies are pretty strict about how much of a raise you can get at any given time. And some companies literally have limits in place like "You can't get more than a 7% raise in one cycle" and things like that. So, if it turns out you took a much lower salary than you're worth, it may not be easy (or even possible) to get a big raise once you're in the door.

## 8. The company already offered the absolute most they can pay

You're a good candidate, and they need you on the team pretty badly. So what if they offered you the absolute best, budget-busting salary they could *possibly* afford? Then there's no way they can pay you more, and you would be negotiating against their best-possible offer. So why bother?

But! How do you *know* they made their best possible offer? And what if there are *other* things you can negotiate in addition to salary?

Companies usually leave themselves some room just in case you negotiate. So they may be making a good offer, but it's pretty unlikely they're making their *best* offer.

I guess that complicates things a little. Hm. Come to think of it, a good way to figure out if they *actually* made their best-possible offer is to negotiate and see if they budge. And even if they can't budge, you can always negotiate non-salary items like vacation, working from home a couple days a week, or a signing bonus.

Aaaaand I came up totally empty here. I promised you 8 reasons you should NOT negotiate your salary and I couldn't make a good case for a single one. I'm going to rethink this piece and try again some other time.

Sorry about that.
