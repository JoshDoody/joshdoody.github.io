## Key takeaways

*   Your "objective" or "positioning" statement should be a short paragraph. If you want to share more about yourself and your qualifications for this role, that's what your cover letter is for.
*   Make your résumé _skimmable_. The hiring manager will probably be in a hurry, so make it easy to skim your résumé for the most relevant information.
*   Make your résumé longer because you _have to_, not because you _can_.
*   When listing your experience, choose the most pertinent activities and describe how they benefited the business whenever possible.
*   Tailor your résumé to the particular job posting by mimicking the job posting language whenever possible.
