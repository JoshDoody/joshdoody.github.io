	<strong><u>Subject:</u></strong> Josh Doody - My thoughts on Tom’s verbal offer
</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi Brittany</p>
<p>I hope you had a great weekend!</p>
<p>I've been considering Tom’s offer over the weekend and everything sounds good, although I would like to discuss the base salary component.</p>
<p>I think I'm a particularly good match for this position, where I would add significant value to ACME Corp. and to the Tom’s Practice from Day One. I have a strong technical background and have built and managed teams of technical people. I am exceptionally good with clients, and have taught short courses on building rapport with and managing clients. I have an MBA and have successfully managed many portfolios of business in the Widget Making industry over the past seven years. I've been working with [Partner Company] for over two and a half years, and have experience with many of their partnership managers and leadership team. I have a strong technical writing background and can both create and delegate the creation of good collateral quickly and efficiently. </p>
<p>All of these qualities contribute directly to the core components of this particular position, and that's why I'm excited for the opportunity to work with Tom and his Practice in this capacity at ACME Corp.</p>
<p>Tom offered $50,000 and I would be more comfortable if we could settle on $56,000. I feel that amount reflects the importance and expectations of the position for ACME Corp’s business, and my qualifications and experience as they relate to this particular position. </p>
<p>Thanks for your time, and I look forward to talking with you on Monday morning at 10:30 ET!</p>
<p>All the best</p>
<p>Josh Doody<br>

This looks like a big block of text, but there's a lot going on here and all of it is by design. Let's walk through the email and dig deeper.

{% include drip_form.html form="salary-negotiation-email-templates" %}

## Open with a greeting 

This salary neogitation email sample is written to the recruiter I’ve been working with throughout the hiring process. Even small things like "I hope you had a great weekend!" can help build rapport with the recruiter. That could be beneficial later on in the salary negotiation process when you need them to go to bat for you.

## Suggest that you want to counter offer, but do not list the amount yet

Then cut to the chase so that this section shows up in the email preview pane if possible: You're pretty happy with the offer, but you want to talk about the base salary component. Don't list your [counter offer]({{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-script/) yet because because you want to make your case _before_ you make a specific ask.

## Make your case

Why make your case instead of just getting to the point? There are two main reasons you want to make your case in your counter offer email:

### 1. Make your counter offer more compelling and easier to accept

By making your case _before_ your counter offer, you're reinforcing the fact that you will add significant value to the company in this role. The better your case, the more reasonable your counter offer will seem.

This is the longest paragraph in the entire email by far. Why? This is a good example of when a wall of text can work in your favor. After one or two sentences, it's pretty obvious this a long list of really compelling reasons that you're a good fit for the company. It's one of the few times it's a _good_ thing if the recruiter doesn't read the entire paragraph. It's a long, dense paragraph specifically so the recruiter will finally think, "Ok, I get it! You're the perfect candidate for this job! What's it going to cost to bring you on board?"

Don't go overboard here, but it's ok if this paragraph is a little long. Six or seven reasons that you're a good fit for the role should do it.

### 2. Give the recruiter a written case to circulate internally

Sometimes, the recruiter will have an approved pay range they can accomodate and they'll have authority to negotiate with you directly without further approval. 

And sometimes they'll need further approval. When they need further approval, you want to make it as easy as possible for them to make a strong case to justify the additional money. You could tell them your case verbally, but then you're counting on them to remember everything and convey it to Finance or whoever can approve additional budget for your salary.

Instead, you're giving them a written case that they can circulate along with their request for additional budget. You will make your own case much better than they will, so giving them your case in writing allows you to make your best case to whoever needs to approve your final salary.

## Re-state the verbal offer

Briefly summarize the offer the hiring manager made so that there's no confusion or miscommunication. If you received a _verbal_ offer, you want to be sure the recruiter is aware of that offer and that it matches what they were told by the hiring manager. If there was a miscommunication internally, now is the time to find out.

##  Make your counter offer (finally!)

State your [counter offer]({{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation/script/) in a firm but neutral way. "...I would be more comfortable if we can settle on $56,000." is a good way to phrase your counter offer. It's not combative, but it is firm and makes it easy for the recruiter to simply reply with "Ok, we can do that." if it's within the budget.

"Are you sure you can't do any better?" is not firm or neutral. That makes it _very_ easy for the recruiter to simply say, "I'm sorry, we can't." By stating the actual amount along with "...I would be more comfortable...", you're forcing the recruiter to acknowledge the amount you counter offered and respond _to that amount_ while making it tougher to simply say "No."

Immediately after your counter offer, summarize your case in a single sentence, just to remind them of the great case you made earlier.

## Confirm or request next steps

In this case, I already had plans to talk with the recruiter on Monday at 10:30 AM, so I simply confirmed that meeting time.

If you don't have a meeting time or clear next steps, be sure to ask what comes next. "Thanks for your time, and please let me know our next steps."

## Send your email to someone you trust for review

Finally, I recommend that you compose an email like the one above, then send it to a couple friends or family members for review. They’ll probably find some typos and might suggest some ways you can tighten it up or make it better. You can always redact the actual numbers if you’re not comfortable sharing them.
