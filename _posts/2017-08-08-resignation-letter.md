## <a name="resignation-letter-template" class="below-nav">Resignation letter template to give your two weeks notice

Keep your resignation letter short and sweet. You want to make it clear that you're leaving and that you plan to wrap up your open projects and facilitate the transitioning of your work to other colleagues. But you don't want to over-communicate.

This letter of resignation template will work for almost any situation whether you're leaving for personal reasons or a great new opportunity at another company.

<div class="sample-email">
<p>
	<strong>To: [Your manager]</strong><br />
	<strong>Subject: [Your name] - Resignation</strong>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Hi [Manager name]</p>
<p>This is my formal notice that I am resigning my position at <strong>[Company name]</strong>. My last day will be <strong>[last anticipated date of employment]</strong>, two weeks from today.</p>
<p><strong>[Optional]</strong> Although I'm giving two weeks notice, I understand it may take time to transition all of my projects to someone else. If needed, I can be available until [final date when you will be available] to help with the transition. I can also be available after my separation date for up to [your availability] hours per week at [your rate] dollars per hour if needed.</p>
<p>I will do everything I can to help make this a smooth transition for you and the team.</p>
<p>It has been a pleasure working with you and our team over the past <strong>[number of years employed]</strong> year<strong>[s]</strong> and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<p><strong>[Your name]</strong></p>
</div>

As you can see, there's an optional paragraph you might add if you have long-running projects that may take more than two weeks to transition *and* you have flexibility in your schedule to work more than two weeks before your final day.

## <a name="last-day-template" class="below-nav">Sample last day at work email to say goodbye to your colleagues
	
Once you've given your notice, you'll work hard to wrap things up before you go. But before your last day, you want to make sure to reach out to say goodbye to your teammates and colleagues and make sure they know how to get in touch.

This is a pretty standard practice nowadays. Usually, people put together an email to their team, or practice, or department, tell them it was great working them, they’ll be missed, and to reach out if they ever need anything. This is about 50% genuine and 50% networking. 

The genuine part is that you’re giving your former coworkers a way to find you if they run into an issue with one of your old responsibilities. The networking part is that you’re sharing your name, email address and phone number so that your coworkers have your contact info in case they find an awesome job you would be right for.

Here’s a short farewell email sample you can use to say goodbye and make sure your former coworkers know how to find you if they need to. This is a real email—slightly modified—that I sent when I left a great job.

<div class='sample-email'>
<p>
	<strong><u>To:</u> [Team mailing list or your colleagues]</strong><br>
	<strong><u>CC:</u></strong> <strong>[Your personal email address]</strong><br>
	<strong><u>Subject:</u></strong> See you around!
</p>

You're making a big career move by leaving your company, and there are big things ahead to focus on. But make sure your resignation letter and goodbye message allow you to leave on the best possible terms so you can continue building your professional network and positioning yourself for greater opportunities in the future.
