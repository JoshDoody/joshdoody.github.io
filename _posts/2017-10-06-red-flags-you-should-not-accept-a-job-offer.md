You've probably heard me say that you should not disclose your current or expected salary when asked for it during your job interviews or salary negotiations. If you haven't (or even if you have), you should bookmark this guide:

[How to answer the current or expected salary question](https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/the-dreaded-salary-question/)

A common follow up question to that guide is...

> I didn't disclose my current or expected salary, but now the recruiter says we can't continue the process unless I share that information. What do I do?

There's a bigger question at play here, and I think it's worth taking a moment to consider when you run into that aggressive recruiter who won't talk to you because you won't share personal information with them.

So here's my answer to that question:

> **Do you really want to work there?**

This is a difficult message to communicate because it's so counterintuitive. If you're interviewing with a company and talking about salary numbers, *of course* you want to work there, right?

But maybe not. Let's take a step back and look at the situation from a different vantage point.

**Looking at the bigger picture**

You want or need a job. This company has a job to be done, and they're considering you as a candidate for that job.

So far, so good.

They have your resume, they know your work history, they have talked to you in interviews and over email. They know their budget for this particular job. They've probably done some market research to see what the going rate is for the kind of job they're trying to fill. They know how many other candidates they're considering. They know how badly they need to fill the job. 

**They already have a lot more information than you do.**

Now they need to decide if *you* are the right candidate for the job.

But before they do that, they need to know your salary history and salary expectations. Huh? What does that have to do with anything?

If they want you to do the job and they know how much they have budgeted to fill the role, why not just make you an offer based on the value they think you'll bring to the role?

Instead, they want *even more* information from you. Furthermore, they're not willing to make you an offer based on the value they perceive you'll bring to their company.

They're taking a shot at getting that infoâ€”more power to them!

But you don't have to share that info, so you reply, "I'd rather not say."

If their response to that is, "We can't continue.", that's a bad sign. It tells you that they're looking for a good candidate with your qualifications who can do good work and add value to their company. 

They're looking for a bargain. *You don't want to be a bargain.*

**This may be the nicest they'll ever be to you.**

This is the courtship phase of your relationship: They should be trying to convince you to join their team. They should be *selling* you, which means there's a good chance that this is the friendliest, most copacetic phase of your relationship with this company.

If they're pushing you around and demanding your personal information *while they're trying to woo you to join their team* what will it be like once they've convinced you to take the lowest salary they could offer and shunted you off to your desk in the basement?

How likely are they to give substantial raises for the high-quality work you will do? How flexible will they be when you want to explore a new career path?

This is difficult to do in practice. It will be a little uncomfortable.

But if you you don't share your current or expected salary and the recruiter shuts down the conversation, that's a big red flag that this isn't the kind of company you want to work for. Find a better opportunity to work for a company that values you and your work.

Don't be a commodity.
