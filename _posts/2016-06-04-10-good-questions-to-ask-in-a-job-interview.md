Your primary goal in the interview process is to get the best job offer possible. Sometimes you can do that by giving great answers to interview questions. But don't overlook the benefits of *asking* good questions during the interview process, starting as earlly as [the pre-interview]({{ site.baseurl }}/pre-interview).

If you reach the end of the job interview and the interviewer asks if you have any questions, use that opportunity to establish yourself as a strong candidate for the position and to learn more about the opportunity you're pursuing.

## Here are 10 good questions to ask in an interview

> **“What does a typical day look like for this role?”**

The answer to this question could help you decide if this is a job you realy want, and this is also an opportunity for you to demonstrate genuine interest in the job itself.

Here's another good question:

> **“What are the greatest challenges for your team right now?”**

A similar and equally useful question is:

> **“What is the greatest challenge for *this particular role*?"**

These questions show that you’re already thinking about the job itself and the answers will help you evaluate whether the job is a good fit for you. You could hear about the day-to-day and realized it's not a good fit for you. Or maybe hearing about the current challenges faced by the team will help you realize you wouldn’t function well in that environment.

Here are some more good questions to ask in an interview:

 * "How long have you been with the company and what is it like working there?"
 * "What can you tell me about the team or group that I would be working with if I get the job?"
 * "What’s the company culture like?"
 * "I noticed this trend in your current job openings—what does that say about the company’s direction right now?"
 * "Can you tell me about career growth opportunities for this job?"
 * "What would a long-term career look like at this company?"
 * "Are there any special initiatives or side projects the team is working on right now?"

Each question is an opportunity to stand out and learn more about the opportunity. And you can often use the information you learn in one interview to give better answers to questions in future interviews.

One last thing—don't force it. If you're out of time or have already addressed all of your questions, it's ok to just tell the interviewer that you don't have anymore questions and thank them for their time.
