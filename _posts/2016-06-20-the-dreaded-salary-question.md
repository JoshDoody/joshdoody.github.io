You've been job hunting for a while, and you finally hear back about a job you really want. The recruiter reaches out and asks if you're free to chat for a few minutes so they can ask you a few questions. "Sure!"

Everything seems pretty straightforward‚Äîyou talk about your background, how you found this job listing, stuff like that. Then the recruiter asks you a question that stops you in your tracks:

> ‚ÄúSo where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?‚Äù

**Wait a minute.** They want to know your current salary and expected salary before you even start your job interviews?

**You intuitively know that sharing your current salary or desired salary probably isn't in your best interest.** But you're also really excited about this opportunity and you don't want to miss out. Plus, you're not sure how to not answer this question.

**What if they *insist?***

What if they tell you the interview process simply can't continue unless you share your current salary or expected salary?

This will usually come up in the "pre-interview" or "pre-screen", which is right at the beginning of the interview process. That's why it's such a sneaky question! It's a salary negotiation tactic disguised as a gatekeeper-type interview question.

So when you hear the salary requirements question, you'll be thinking "What do I need to say to get to my next interview? They asked for my current salary and expected salary, so I'll tell them that so we can move on."

It's easier to understand the current and desired salary questions if we answer another question first: What is the recruiter or hiring manager *really* asking for here?

Let's take each question‚Äîcurrent salary and expected salary‚Äìseparately.

## <a name="current-salary-question" class="below-nav">‚ÄúWhat's your current salary?‚Äù

This question is pretty straightforward, but not nearly as innocuous as it may sound. Here's a different way of looking at this question:

> "What's the minimum salary we need to offer to convince you to change companies?"

Let's pause for a moment because this is important. I know you might be thinking about the last time this came up, and you told them your current salary, and they offered you *more* than that.

This is not a coincidence, and it's not them paying you more than you're worth. You told them your current salary was $48,000 and they offered you $50,000. Or you told them your current salary was $75,000 and they offered you $78,000. I realize this *feels* like "They paid me more than I asked for!" and it looks like a win. 

But this is normal. They made you an offer that they hoped was just enough to entice you to leave your current job and go work for them. It was more, **but it was not the best compensation they could offer you.**

When you disclosed your current salary, you gave them an easy out: they just took your answer and added a couple thousand dollars.

The good news is the new offer was higher than your current salary was. The bad news is you probably could've gotten more if you hadn't shared your current salary with the recruiter.

## <a name="expected-salary-question" class="below-nav">‚ÄúWhat's your expected salary?‚Äù

This question is a little trickier because it *sounds* like they're giving you a chance to set the baseline for your new salary. It *sounds* like they're asking you to contribute to the terms of the job offer you'll hopefully get later.

But let's re-frame this question to reflect what they're *really* asking for:

> "Can you take a wild guess what salary we might pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you applied for?"

The truth is you probably have no idea what they pay people because that decision‚Äîwhat a company pays someone to do a job‚Äîis dependent on lots of factors that have nothing to do with *your* particular qualifications to do the job.

For example, what's their hiring budget? How many positions do they need to fill for this job? How badly do they need to fill those positions? How's the company doing in terms of revenue, profits, and growth?

When you answer the salary expectations question, you're literally guessing a number that depends on tons factors you can't assess.

But it gets worse.

What are the odds that you'll actually guess the salary they're willing to pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you're interviewing for? Practically nil, right? You're almost certainly going to over- or under-estimate what they're willing to pay.

I know what you're thinking, and it's still a bad idea. 

> "What if I just state a really big expected salary and overshoot their range?"

To which I say, "How confident are you that you know where the top of their pay range is?" I guess you could just say, "I would like to make one million dollars!" but what good would *that* do?

**You can't win if you guess at their salaries.**

If you underestimate what they're willing to pay, you're leaving money on the table. If the real answer is that they would compensate someone like you up to $75,000 dollars, and you guess they would pay a salary of only $65,000, you very literally may have just cost yourself $10,000. 

The one thing that might save you is when you guess so badly that you under-shoot the minimum salary they can pay you to do the job. For example, you might tell them your expected salary is $65,000, but the minimum they pay for that job is $70,000. Then they would pay you $70,000 even though you "only" asked for $65,000‚Äîa huge win! Except they're paying you the absolute minimum salary they possibly can, and you could've gotten a lot more.

If you *over*estimate and tell them your salary expectation is $85,000, you may set off red flags that cause them to rethink the interview process altogether. This is pretty rare, but you could disqualify yourself by being "too expensive" for them. If your expected salary is well above their budgeted pay range, they may just move on to other similar candidates with lower salary expectations.

The bottom line is you probably aren‚Äôt going to guess what their salary structure looks like, and if you try to guess you‚Äôll cost yourself a lot of money.

This sounds pretty bad, right?

But wait! It gets *even worse*!

## The "real" salary they're willing to pay could increase throughout your interview

So they've asked you to guess what they're willing to pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you applied for. And you'll almost certainly guess wrong and cost yourself money or even an opportunity to continue interviewing.

**What most people don't know is that their own answer to the question could change as you move through the interview process.**

Sounds crazy, right? But it's true. Here's how.

Your job in the interview process is to tell a story about how their company or team will be better if they hire you. Each interview is another opportunity for you to tell this story in a more convincing way to another person at the company.

The better you are at telling this story, the more they'll want to hire you. The more they want to hire you, the more they'll be willing to pay, and they could literally change the budgeted salary specifically to give them a better shot at bringing you on board.

Let's go back to our example earlier. Let's say they're hiring you for a role whose budget is $75,000. They ask you to guess what that budget is by sharing your expected salary, and you decline to guess because you read this article üòâ

So you move on to the next stage of the interview process and do well. Then you talk to another person and you do well. Then you talk to the hiring manager and you do *really* well.

Now it's time for them to decide whether to extend a job offer. They *definitely* want to make you an offer because you've done such a great job of convincing them that their company will be better if you're a part of it. They *really* want to bring you on board.

**You've flipped their thinking.**

When they first started talking to you, they were thinking:

> "What's the minimum salary we would need to offer to bring this person on board?"

Now they're thinking:

> "How much compensation do we need to offer to convince this person to join our team?"

See the difference? Before, they were looking for a *minimum* compensation number. Now, they're looking for a *compelling* compensation number.

Before they make you an offer, they're going to huddle up internally, and the conversation might go something like this:

> **Hiring Manager:** "This is the perfect candidate for the job. We've been trying to fill this position for two months, and we haven't seen any other candidates this strong. What did they say their expected salary is? What do they want?"

> **Recruiter:** "They didn't share their salary expectations. Just said they would prefer to focus on the value they can add and that they want this to be a big step forward for them."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Huh. Ok. So what's our budget for this role?"

> **Recruiter:** "Well, we budgeted $75,000, but I'm not sure if that's going to be enough. How badly do you want this person to join your team?"

> **Hiring Manager:** "I mean, this is the perfect candidate. I don't want anyone else. This is it. How much wiggle room do we have on that $75,000 budget?"

> **Recruiter:** "The paygrade for this job caps out at $80,000."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Gosh. I'm not sure that will be enough. I don't want to lose this candidate. What else can we do?"

> **Recruiter:** "Well, we're interviewing them for a Grade 2 position, so that's why it caps out at $80,000. But the Grade 3 'Senior' position for this role goes up to $95,000. The requisition is a Grade 2, but we could look at slotting them into the Grade 3 position and that would give us more room to work."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Ok, let's do that. And we'll offer... $80,000? And that gives us room to maneuver if they want to negotiate."

> **Recruiter:** "Sounds good. Let me get the other compensation numbers for the offer and then you can give them a call and offer them $80k and clarify that we're considering them for the Grade 3 position."

To recap:

- They had a salary range in mind.
- You convinced them that *you* are the candidate they need.
- They redefined the role to give them more room to pay you.
- They made a strong offer with room to [counter offer]({{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-script) and negotiate.

If you had told them your expected salary, you may not have even gotten this far. True, maybe your guess would've been good. But what if you guessed lower? You would've cost yourself money. What if you guess higher? They may not have continued interviewing you if you were "too expensive", and you never would have had the opportunity to show them that you're the ideal candidate for the position they're trying to fill.

And all of this is just to get a strong *initial* job offer. You can *continue* telling your story when you counter offer (see this [salary negotiation email sample]({{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-email-sample/) for an example of how you continue telling your story even as you counter offer), and that may drive their budget even higher. 

Now that we've talked about why sharing your current salary or expected salary is such a bad idea, let's talk about how to avoid sharing that information.

We'll break this down into two parts: "What's your current salary?" and "What's your expected salary?"

For eaach of these, your job is to redirect the conversation back to the interview process and away from sharing sensitive information that could cost you a lot of money down the road.

## <a name="current-salary-answer" class="below-nav">How to answer the "What's your current salary?" interview question

For the "current salary" part of the question, you need to do two things:

1. **Express your discomfort.** By telling the recruiter or hiring manager that this question makes you uncomfortable, they'll be more likely to let you off the hook.
2. **Tactfully turn the focus from your past to the present opportunity.** You've told them the question makes you uncomfortable and you can help them keep moving by telling them what you *are* comfortable discussing: the present opportunity they're considering you for and how you'll add value to their team.

It‚Äôs true that they may do some digging and put together a good educated guess as to what you‚Äôre making anyway, but maybe they won‚Äôt. If they don‚Äôt know what you're currently making, that makes it more difficult for them to base an offer on your current salary, and that‚Äôs probably going to mean a higher initial offer for you. 

It also means that their eventual offer will need to reflect both your market value and the value you‚Äôll add to the company without being biased by your current salary.

<div data-offer-plinko="optional">
{% include drip_forms/salary-question-scripts-content-upgrade.html %}
</div>

## <a name="expected-salary-answer" class="below-nav">How to answer the "What's your expected salary?" interview question
 
Remember: They're basically asking you to take a guess what they might pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job they're hiring for. You're virtually guaranteed to guess wrong, and guessing wrong will cost you money. So don't guess!

Instead, take the opportunity to emphasize two things:

1. **You want to take on more responsibility.** They have your r√©sum√© and know your background (that's why they're talking to you), and this is a great chance to let them know that you want to do even more for their company when you get the opportunity.
2. **You want to be compensated for that additional responsibility.** Companies pay people to do a job, and you're telling them you intend to do even more for *this* job than you've ever done before, which implies you would like to make more money than you've ever made before. Of course, they don't know what you're making, but this will signal to them that an eventual job offer should be strong because of your demonstrated ability to add value to their company.

By emphasizing those two things, you will turn this question into an opportunity to reiterate that you are focused on improiving their company and adding value, and to signal that they'll need to make a strong job offer to bring you on board.

Although you probably don't know the pay range for the job you're pursuing, *they do*, and they will interpret this to mean, "We need to make a strong offer near the top of our pay range in order to convince this person to join our team."

{% include drip_forms/salary-question-scripts-content-upgrade.html %}
</div>

## <a name="when-they-ask-again" class="below-nav">What if they ask again?

So you managed to answer their questions without disclosing your salary history or expectations, and you're feeling pretty good. Excellent!

Most of the time, that's all it takes. Most recruiters won't put up too much of a fight because asking those questions just slows them down. They want to fill the position just as badly as you want the job. But they often *have to* ask you about your salary requirements, so they do. Once your refuse to share, they can check that item off the list and move on.

But! Sometimes they'll be more persistent and try to find another way to ask. Here's what that sounds like:

> "I really need something to share with HR."

...or...

> "We can't move forward without this information."

The first thing to try is just repeating that you're not comfortable answering these questions and emphasize the same things you did before. 

Sometimes that will work because they were willing to take one more pass at getting you to share your salary expectations. But what if *that* doesn't work and they *insist* on getting this information?

### Yes, this is uncomfortable. The discomfort is worth it.

You may have gotten this far just because you believe I know what I'm talking about. I made a good case that you shouldn't share your salary expectations, you bought in, and you survived one or two volleys with the recruiter just based on the script above.

*But they didn't give up!* And now things feel awkward, and there's a lot of pressure, and what if they just stop talking to you and go find an easier, more agreeable candidate for this job?

**I take off my "author" hat and put on my "coach" hat**

Let me emphasize that sharing your current salary or your expected salary *is not in your best interest*. Those two pieces of information‚Äîyour salary expectations‚Äîare two of three unique pieces of information you have:

1. Your current salary
2. Your expected salary
3. How badly you need or want the job

That's basically all of the unique information you have.

Let's compare that to the unique pieces of information the company has:

1. The salary range for the position
2. The overall compensation budget available
3. How many of these positions they're trying to fill
4. How long they've been trying to fill the position
5. How badly they need to fill the position
6. How many other candidates they have to consider for the job
7. How much they like *you* for the position relative to those candidates

I'm going to stop because you're bored, but you get the point. If you give them two of the three unique pieces of information you have, you're down to 1. And they're up from *a lot of information that you don't have* to *all but one piece of information*.

**But what if they stop interviewing me?**

My coaching clients ask me this a lot. I have two answers:

**1. They won't.**

They're interviewing you because you're a qualified candidate, and they need a qualified candidate. That's their primary objective. They would *also* like to get a good deal on which ever candidate they choose, but first they have to find the right candidate.

They're not going to stop interviewing you just because you don't make it easier for them to get a good deal on you.

**2. So what if they do?**

If they discontinue the interview process because you won't share two of the three unique pieces of information you have, then they're *extremely* motivated to get a bargain on your skillset and experience, and they're not focused on finding the right candidate for the role itself.

That's bad news for you even if you get the job. Do you really want to work somewhere that is so myopic that they ignore perfectly qualified candidates simply because the candidate won't make the negotiation easier by sharing their compensation requirements?

I can't answer that question for you, but I can tell you my answer: "Nope."

## <a name="already-shared-current-salary" class="below-nav">How to recover if you've already disclosed your current salary

So how do you recover if you've already disclosed your current salary depends how early you are in the interview process? Let's take the interview process in two phases:

1. Early in the process‚ÄîYou haven't started your formal interviews yet
2. Late in the process‚ÄîYou already have a job offer

**1. You haven't started your formal interviews yet**

There's still time!

The problem you need to overcome is that most companies start by thinking, "What's the minimum we need to offer this person to get them to take the job?"

Unfortunately, they have a simple formula to find that "minimum" number they need to offer: your current salary plus a little more to entice you to make the leap.

You want to switch their thinking to, "What do we have to offer this person to convince them to take the job?"

See the difference?

In the first one, they're looking for the smallest number they can get away with. In the second one, they're looking for a number big enough to convince you to make the leap. These are probably two *very* different numbers.

**How you change their thinking**

At every stage of the interview process, **your primary goal is to tell a story about how their company will be better with you on their team**. Just keep telling that story over and over again.

Every time they ask you a question, think, "How can I answer this question in a way that adds another chapter to the story about how their company will be better if they bring me on board?"

If you do change their thinking from "minimum number" to "biggest number necessary", they may forget that you told them your current salary and focus on making a compelling offer instead.

That may be enough to break away from your current salary, but what if you try this and still get an offer that's based on your current salary?

**2. You already have a job offer**

You may have experienced something like this:

You got a job offer, and felt great because it was more than you were currently making. Then, a few minutes later you thought, "Wait a minute. This offer is just my current salary plus 5%! Is that a coincidence?"

Nope, it's not a coincidence üòï

Once you get this far, it's much harder to recover and drastically improve your offer. But you have a couple options based on your own assessment of your [minimum acceptable salary(/minimum-acceptable-salary/):

 1. If a counter of 10-20% above their offer is above your minimum acceptable salary, then that's your best move. You could negotiate more than your minimum or you can fall back to your minimum as your line in the sand (your walk away number).
 2. If that won't work, you can use this [technique to negotiate a lowball job offer](/how-to-negotiate-a-lowball-job-offer/)‚Äîask them if they can make improvements to the offer so you can consider them. This is your way of letting them know that they need to switch their thinking from "minimum" to "most convincing".

Your options are slim, but you do have options even if you've already disclosed your current salary!

## <a name="already-shared-expected-salary" class="below-nav">How to recover if you stated your expected salary and the offer meets or exceeds it

What if you already declared your expected salary and they made an offer that meets or exceeds it, but you want to negotiate for something even higher. How do you do that?

**Look for new information you can incorporate into your negotiation**‚Äîways in which your understanding of the position has changed since you declared your salary range. Here are two examples:

- The job requirements are different than you thought they were‚Äîthere's more responsibility than you anticipated.
- The overall benefits package isn't what you anticipated‚Äîthere's less paid vacation or sick time, the available health insurance coverage isn't as robust as you thought, etc.

Once you identify one or more things, wait for them to make an offer, which will probably be either below or at the low end of the expected salary range you disclosed. Then you can negotiate by saying something like this:

> "I have learned a lot more about the company, the position, and the compensation package since I gave that initial salary range. Given what I've learned, I would be more comfortable at [your counteroffer]."

It's problematic to declare a expected salary range early in the interview process because you don't know enough about the job, the company, and the available perks to pick a salary. But even if you already shared an expected salary, there are still ways to negotiate and improve your job offer.

## <a name="summary" class="below-nav">Summarizing your options for answering the salary expectations question

We've covered a lot of ground here, so let me give you a short-and-sweet summary of the scripts you can use to avoid sharing your current salary and expected salary when asked for your salary expectations in a job interview.

Here's salary expectations question again:

> *‚ÄúSo where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?"*

And here's how you should answer each part of that question:

### The current salary question

For the "current salary" part of the question, you need to do two things:

1. Express your discomfort.
2. Tactfully turn the focus from your past to the present opportunity.

### The salary expectations question

Take the opportunity to emphasize two things:

1. You want to take on more responsibility.
2. You want to be compensated for that additional responsibility.
