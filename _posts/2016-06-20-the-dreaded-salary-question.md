What should you say when asked for your current salary or desired salary in an interview?

This will usually come up in the "pre-interview" or "pre-screen", which is right at the beginning of the interview process. That's why it's such a sneaky question! It's a salary negotiation tactic disguised as a gatekeeper-type interview question.

So when you hear this question, you'll be thinking "What do I need to say to get to my next interview? They asked for my current and desired salary, so I'll tell them that to move on."

Here's what that question usually looks like.

> *“So where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?"*

## How to respond to the dreaded salary question 

It's easier to understand this question if we answer another one first: What is the recruiter or hiring manager *really* asking for here?

**What's your current salary?**

This question is pretty straightforward, but not nearly as innocuous as it may sound. Here's a different way of looking at this question:

> "What's the minimum salary we need to offer to convince you to change companies?"

Let's pause for a moment because this is important. I know you might be thinking about the last time this came up, and you told them your current salary, and they offered you *more* than that.

This is not a coincidence, and it's not them paying you more than you're worth. You told them $48,000 and they offered you $50,000. Or you told them $75,000 and they offered you $78,000. I realize this *feels* like "They paid me more than I asked for!" and it looks like a win. 

But this is normal. They made you an offer that they hoped was just enough to entice you to leave your current job and go work for them. It was more, **but it was not the most they could offer you.**

When you disclosed your current salary, you gave them an easy out: they just took your answer and added a couple thousand dollars.

The good news is the new offer was higher than your current salary was. The bad news is you probably could've gotten more if you hadn't shared your current salary with the recruiter.

**What's your desired salary?**

This question is a little trickier because it *sounds* like they're giving you a chance to set the baseline for your new salary. It *sounds* like they're asking you to contribute to the terms of the offer you'll hopefully get later.

But let's re-frame this question to reflect what they're *really* asking you:

> "Can you take a wild guess what we might pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you applied for?"

The truth is you probably have no idea what they pay people because that decision—what a company pays someone to do a job—is dependent on lots of factors that have nothing to do with *your* particular qualifications to do the job.

For example, what's their hiring budget? How many positions do they need to fill for this job? How badly do they need to fill those positions? How's the company doing in terms of revenue, profits, and growth?

When you answer this question, you're literally guessing a number that depends on tons factors you can't access.

But it gets worse.

What are the odds that you'll actually guess the number they're willing to pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you're interviewing for? Practically nil, right? You're almost certainly going to over- or under-estimate what they're willing to pay.

I know what you're thinking, and it's still a bad idea. 

> "What if I just name a really big number and overshoot their range?"

To which I say, "How confident are you that you know where the top of their range is?" I guess you could just say, "I would like to make one million dollars!" but what good would *that* do?

So you can't win if you guess at their salaries.

If you underestimate, you're leaving money on the table. If the real answer is that they would pay someone like you up to $75,000 dollars, and you guess they would pay only $65,000, you very literally may have just cost yourself $10,000. 

The one thing that might save you money is if you guessed so badly that you under-shot the minimum they can pay you to do the job. For example, you guessed $65,000, but the minium they pay for that job is $70,000. Then they would pay you $70,000 even though you "only" asked for $65,000—a huge win! Except they're paying you the absolute minimum they possibly can, and you could've gotten a lot more.

If you *over*estimate and guess $85,000, you may set off red flags that cause them to rethink the interview process altogether. This is pretty rare, but you could disqualify yourself by being "too expensive" for htem. If your desired salary is well above their budgeted range, they may just move on to other similar candidates.

This sounds pretty bad, right?

But wait! It gets *even worse*!

## The "real" amount they're willing to pay could increase throughout your interview

So they've asked you to guess what they're willing to pay someone with your skillset and experience to do the job you applied for. And you'll almost certainly guess wrong and cost yourself money or even an opportunity to continue interviewing.

**Their own answer to the question could change as you move through the interview process.**

Sounds crazy, right? But it's true. Here's how.

Your job in the interview process is to tell a story about how their company or team will be better if you're a part of it. Each interview is another opportunity for you to tell this story in a more convincing way to another person at the company.

The better you are at telling this story, the more they'll want to hire you. The more they want to hire you, the more they'll be willing to pay, and they could literally change the budgeted salary specifically to give them a better shot at bringing you on board.

Let's go back to our example earlier. Let's say they're hiring you for a role whose budget is $75,000. They ask you to guess what that budget is, and you decline to guess because you ready this article 😉

So you move on to the next stage of the interview and do well. Then you talk to another person and you do well. Then you talk to the hiring manager and you do *really* well.

Now it's time for them to decide whether to extend an offer. They *definitely* want to extend an offer because you've done such a great job of convincing them that their company will be better if you're a part. They *really* want to bring you on board.

**You've flipped their thinking.**

When they first started talking to you, they were thinking:

> "What's the minimum salary we would need to offer to bring this person on board?"

Now they're thinking:

> "How much do we need to offer to convince this person to join our team?"

See the difference? Before, they were looking for a *minimum* number. Now, they're looking for a *compelling* number.

Before they make you an offer, they're going to huddle up internally, and the conversation might go something like this:

> **Hiring Manager:** "This is the perfect candidate for this job. We've been trying to fill this role for two months, and we haven't seen any other candidates this strong. What did they say their desired salary is? What do they want?"

> **Recruiter:** "They didn't give a desired salary. Said they would prefer to focus on the value they can add and that they want this to be a big step forward for them."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Huh. Ok. So what's our budget for this role?"

> **Recruiter:** "Well, we budgeted $75,000, but I'm not sure if that's going to be enough. How badly do you want this person to join your team?"

> **Hiring Manager:** "I mean, this is the perfect candidate. I don't want anyone else. This is it. How much wiggle room do we have on that $75,000 budget?"

> **Recruiter:** "The paygrade for this job caps out at $80,000."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Gosh. I'm not sure that will be enough. I don't want to lose this candidate. What else can we do?"

> **Recruiter:** "Well, we're interviewing them for a Grade 2 position, so that's why it caps out at $80,000. But the Grade 3 'Senior' position for this role goes up to $95,000. The requisition is a Grade 2, but we could look at slotting them into the Grade 3 position and that would give us more room to work."

> **Hiring Manager:** "Ok, let's do that. And we'll offer... $80,000? And that gives us room to maneuver if they want more than that."

> **Recruiter:** "Sounds good. Let me get the other numbers for the offer and then you can give them a call and offer them $80k and clarify that we're considering them for the Grade 3 position."

To recap:

- They had a range in mind.
- You convinced them that *you* are the candidate they need.
- They redefined the role to give them more room to pay you.
- They made a strong offer with room to negotiate.

If you had told them your desired salary, you may not have even gotten this far. True, maybe your guess would've been good. But what if you guessed lower? You would've cost yourself money. What if you guess higher? They may not have continued interviewing you if you were "too expensive".

Now that we've talked about why sharing your current salary or desired salary is such a bad idea, let's loop back to the question at the beginning of this article:

## What should you say when asked for your current salary or desired salary in an interview?

Here's a short video with the basics. Then I'll tell you more about the nuances of this question and what to do when they don't give up so easily :)

<div class="video-container">

</div>

Let's break this down into two parts: "What's your current salary?" and "What's your desired salary?"

### "What's your current salary?"

For the "current salary" part of the question, I recommend something like this:

> "I’m not really comfortable sharing that information. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company and not what I’m paid at my current job."
 
It’s true that they may do some digging and put together a good educated guess as to what you’re making anyway, but maybe they won’t. If they don’t know what you’re currently making, that makes it more difficult for them to base an offer on your current salary, and that’s probably going to mean a higher initial offer for you. 

It also means that their eventual offer will need to reflect both your market value and the value you’ll add to the company without being biased by what you currently make.

### "What's your desired salary?"
 
My pat answer to the "what are you looking for" part of the dreaded salary question is this:

> "I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation."

This answer demonstrates that you want to contribute to the company by taking on additional responsibilities and that you want to be paid well for those contributions.

### The answer to The Dreaded Salary Question

Here is my recommendation for a good answer to the full dreaded salary question: 

> "I’m not comfortable sharing my current salary. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job. I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skillset and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation."

<p class='u-center'><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DreadedSalaryQuestion.png" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DreadedSalaryQuestion.png" alt="The Dreaded Salary Quesiton" style="display: block; width: 100%; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;"/></a></p>

So let's say that you're playing a game, and your goal is to get past The Dreaded Salary Question without sharing your salary requirements. This is Level 1, and the script I just gave you will usually win the game.

## What if that's not enough?

So you got to the end of Level 1, and you're feeling pretty good that you didn't disclose your salary requirements. Excellent!

Most of the time, that's all it takes. Most recruiters won't put up too much of a fight because asking those questions just slows them down. They want to fill the position just as badly as you want the job. But they often *have to* ask you about your salary requirements, so they do. Once your refuse to share, they can check that item off the list and move on.

But! Sometimes you complete Level 1 and the game doesn't end. Instead, you move on to Level 2, where the pressure ramps up. Here's what that sounds like:

> "I really need something to share with HR."

...or...

> "We can't move forward without this information."

The first thing to try is just repeating that you're not comfortable answering these questions:

> "I'm just not comfortable discussing my current or desired salary. I prefer to focus on the value I can add in this position, and I look forward to hearing what you think is appropriate."

Sometimes that will work because they were willing to take one more pass at getting you to share your salary requirements. But what if *that* doesn't work and they *insist* on getting this information?

### Yes, this is uncomfortable. Yes, the discomfort is worth it.

You may have gotten this far just because you believe I know what I'm talking about. I made a good case that you shouldn't share your salary requirements, you bought in, and you survived one or two volleys with the recruiter just based on the script above.

*But they didn't give up!* And now things feel awkward, and there's a lot of pressure, and what if they just stop talking to you and go find an easier, more agreeable candidate?

**Josh takes off his "author" hat and puts on his "coach" hat**

Let me emphasize that sharing your current salary or your desired salary *is not in your best interest*. Those two pieces of information are two of three unique pieces of information you have:

1. Your current salary
2. Your desired salary
3. How badly you need or want the job

That's basically all of the unique information you have.

Let's compare that to the unique pieces of information the company has:

1. The salary range for the position
2. The overall budget available
3. How many of these positions they're trying to fill
4. How long they've been trying to fill the position
5. How badly they need to fill the position
6. How many other candidates they have to consider
7. How much they like *you* for the position relative to those candidates

I'm going to stop because you're bored, but you get the point. If you give them two of the three pieces of information you have, you're down to 1. And they're up from *a lot of information that you don't have* to *all but one piece of information*.

**But what if they stop interviewing me?**

My coaching clients ask me this a lot. I have two answers:

**1. They won't.**

They're interviewing you because you're a qualified candidate, and they need a qualified candidate. That's their primary objective. They would *also* like to get a good deal on which ever candidate they choose, but first they have to find the right candidate.

They're not going to stop interviewing you just because you don't make it easier for them to get a good deal on you.

**2. So what if they do?**

If they discontinue the interview process because you won't share two of the three unique pieces of information you have, then they're *extremely* motivated to get a bargain on your skillset and experience, and they're not focused on finding the right candidate for the role itself.

That's bad news for you even if you get the job. Do you really want to work somewhere that is so myopic that they ignore perfectly qualified candidates simply because the candidate won't make the negotiation easier?

I can't answer that question for you, but I can tell you my answer: "Nope."

## What if they keep pushing?

So you gave my pat answer and completed Level 1. But the game kept going and now you're at Level 2 and they're asking *again*. What do you say to complete Level 2 and end this awkward conversation?

By now they've probably either implied or straight-out said something like this:

> "I just need to be sure the salary range works for your requirements so we don't waste each other's time."

Nobody likes wasting time, and you especially don't want to waste someone's time when they might be the gatekeeper for a great job opportunity, right? So you're inclined to just give them what they need so and get on with the interviews.

But instead, I recommend a little conversational Judo—use the reason they gave for asking *again* as your own leverage. Here's how:

> "It sounds like you're trying to qualify me for a salary range. If you want to tell me what that range is, I'm happy to tell you if it's in the ballpark."

They claim they need to qualify you for a range, but they are also asking you to give up one of your precious pieces of information to do that. Instead, just ask them for the range.

The nice thing about the way I've worded this script is that you're still not actually committing to accepting an offer in that range. You're saying it's "in the ballpark". This matters because you still have full latitude to negotiate later on once they finally make you an offer.

(Yes, this is a semantic argument. This is about the the diciest semantic argument you'll hear me make.)

So this is how you complete Level 2, and then it's over right? Usually, but there are some recruiters who are very persistent and they will continue pushing. They may even claim the interview process cannot continue if you don't share your salary requirements.

I already covered why I think this is silly, so let's just cut to the chase: **How do you end this conversation without sharing your current salary or desired salary?**

## Here's your trump card

This is Level 3. It's the last level in this game. You've told them your uncomfortable sharing your salary requirements, and they persisted. You've told them you're happy to confirm if the range they've budgeted is in the ballpark of what you'll consider, and they persisted. 

There aren't many options left, but this one is very effective. Here we go:

> "I'm not comfortable sharing my current employer's proprietary information about how they pay people, and I know they wouldn't appreciate it if I did. I still work for them, and I'm just not comfortable sharing that information. I really don't have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and I look forward to hearing what you suggest."

This is a heavy-handed answer, but it's necessary because of the situation. You're basically saying, "I have ethical qualms with giving you the information you're demanding." This has the advantage of putting the pressure back on the recruiter, who now has a clear Catch-22 if they continue to press: They're asking you do something you see as unethical to move forward, but they probably don't want to hire someone unethical.

If they *still* press after thi answer, I'm all out of ideas because I've never seen anyone fail to complete the game with this script.

## Summarizing your options

We've covered a lot of ground here, so let me give you a short-and-sweet summary of the scripts you can use to avoid sharing your current salary and desired salary when asked for your salary requirements in an interview.

Here's The Dreaded Salary Question again:

> *“So where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?"*

### Level 1 answer

> "I’m not comfortable sharing my current salary. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job. I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skillset and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation."

If they keep pushing with that longer answer, you can shorten it up and try again:

> "I'm just not comfortable discussing my current or desired salary. I prefer to focus on the value I can add in this position, and I look forward to hearing what you think is appropriate."

### Level 2 answer

If the Level 1 answer doesn't quite work, it's time to move on to Level 2, which requires a slightly more sophisticated answer:

> "It sounds like you're trying to qualify me for a salary range. If you want to tell me what that range is, I'm happy to tell you if it's in the ballpark."

And if *that* doesn't work, you can reach for the trump card—the Level 3 answer...

### Level 3 answer

> "I'm not comfortable sharing my employer's proprietary information about how they pay people, and I know they wouldn't appreciate it if I did. I still work for them, and I'm just not comfortable sharing that information. I really don't have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and I look forward to hearing what you suggest."
