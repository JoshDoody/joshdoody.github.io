## In person interviews

Here's what you should bring to your in person interviews, plus a couple other considerations.

<ul class="checkbox-list">
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Be early</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Copies of your résumé</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Notebook and pen</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Dress one level above the company dress code</strong></li>
</ul>

### Be early

Get to the office about 15 minutes ahead of time. This will allow you time to check in, get a visitor's badge, and handle anything else you need to handle before your interview. It also demonstrates that you're a punctual professional who can be depended upon.

### Copies of your résumé

You probably already submitted your résumé online or emailed it in. But there's a good chance the specific person who interviews you will not have it already. 

So bring a few copies of your résumé to hand out if you need them. Not only will this help your interviews go more smoothly, but it will remind your interviewers that you're a professional who came prepared.

### Notebook and pen

You'll need something to carry those copies of your résumé, so you might as well keep them in a notebook. Take notes in your interview any time something interesting comes up. If you're asked a question you don't know, write it down. If you discuss possible start dates, write them down. If your interviewer suggests a book for you to read, write it down.

Don't use the notebook as a crutch, but do use it to take some notes and show the interviewer that you're paying attention and that you plan to follow up after your interview.

### Dress one level above the company dress code

The rule of thumb is to dress one level above the company dress code so you stand out without being overdressed. If you can't find the company dress code online, you can ask your contact at the company (whoever you talk to when you schedule your interview).

Here's what I recommend for men who are going on interviews (I don't want to embarass myself by giving ladies adviceo on what to wear):

If the company wears jeans and t-shirts, you could wear jeans and a button-down shirt. If the company wears jeans and button-downs, wear slacks and a tucket-in button-down. If they wear slacks and a tucked-in button-down, wear that plus a tie. If they were that plus a tie, wear a suit.

## Phone call interviews

<ul class="checkbox-list">
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Be early</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Résumé ready to email</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Computer or notebook</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>A quiet room to talk</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Earbuds or some kind of hands-free headset</strong></li>
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Water</strong></li>
</ul>

### Be early

Your interviewer is probably going to call you to start the interview. So make sure you're ready for the call at least 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting time. That means you're set up at a desk or table, set up and ready to answer the phone and get started.

Don't answer the phone and say, "Hello?" ... "Oh hi Tracy! Just a minute, let me close this door." The door is already closed. You're already seated and ready to begin the interview.

### Résumé ready to email

You probably already submitted your résumé online or emailed it in. But there's a good chance the specific person who interviews you will not have it already. 

So have your résumé ready to email just in case you need it. I recommend having it available in Microsoft Word and PDF formats. Not only will this help your interviews go more smoothly, but it will remind your interviewers that you're a professional who came prepared.

### Computer or notebook

Take notes in your interview any time something interesting comes up. If you're asked a question you don't know, write it down. If you discuss possible start dates, write them down. If your interviewer suggests a book for you to read, write it down.

If you're taking notes on your computer, make sure you tell your interviewer that at the beginning of the interview so they don't think you're goofing off on Facebook. "You might hear me typing in the background—I'm just taking some notes."

Don't use note taking as a crutch, but take some notes and show the interviewer that you're paying attention and that you plan to follow up after your interview.

### A quiet room to talk

Do your best to find a quiet place to take this phone call. It's a very important phone call and you need to be able to concentrate. You don't want you or your interviewer to be distracted by background noise. 

Also, if you're interviewing for a remote job, your interviewer will notice if you're in a noisy environment. It's a small thing, but many managers will be leery of hiring someone who will be a distraction on every conference call.

### Earbuds or some kind of hands-free headset

Keep your hands free so you can take notes. It's hard to take notes when you're cradling your phone with your shoulder.

### Water

Have some water handy in case your voice starts to give out. If you're excited for the interview and you do a lot of talking, your throat could dry out so it's tough for you to talk. That could hamper your interview.
