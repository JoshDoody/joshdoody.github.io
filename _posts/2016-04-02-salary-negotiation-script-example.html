  <p><strong>Once you've responded to your job offer with a counter offer, the company will probably respond with something between your job offer and your counteroffer.</strong> That's your negotiation window. Your goal is to maximize your salary within that window.</p>
	
	<p>Here's a salary negotiation counteroffer calculator you can use to determine your counter offer: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-script">Salary negotiation script generator and counteroffer calculator</a>
		
	<h2>Salary negotiation script example from a real negotiation</h2>

  <p>In this example the company has made <em class='u-highlight'>an offer of <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span></em>, and <em class='u-highlight'>you have countered at <span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>. Your <em class='u-highlight'>negotiation window is now <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span>â€“<span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>. This sample salary negotiation script is your plan for hashing out the final details of your compensation package in the Final Discussion by <em>first</em> maximizing your base salary and <em>then</em> negotiating for additional benefits.</p>

  <p>(Your <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/minimum-acceptable-salary/">Minimum Acceptable Salary</a> is the underlined row.)</p>

  <h3><u><span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></u> (Counter)</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li><strong>$55,000</strong> - Sounds good, when do I start?</li>
		<li><strong>$54,000</strong> - $55,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
		<li><strong>$53,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
		<li><u><strong>$52,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</u></li>
		<li><strong>$51,000</strong> - I can't accept less than $52,000.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><u><span class="original-offer">$50,000</span></u> (Offer)</h3>

  <h2>How to use this script</h2>

  <p>The company will discuss your counter internally and determine how much they can pay you. Then you will often have a quick phone call with the recruiter or hiring manager to determine your final salary and other benefits.</p>

  <p>When the company responds to your counter, <em class='u-highlight'>use this script to maximize your starting salary and benefits</em>. For each step, if they accept your proposal, then you're finished. If they don't accept your proposal, go to the next step.</p>

  <ol>
		<li><strong>Use the first statement as your first response.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $55,000, you'll say, "Sounds good, when do I start?" If the company comes back with $54,000, you'll say, "$55,000 and I'm on board!"
		</li>
		<li><p><strong>If they do not accept your first response, take the current salary as your base and request your highest-priority benefit.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $53,000, then you say "If you can do $54,000, I'm on board!"</p>
		  <p>If they stick with $53,000, then you would say, "I understand the best you can do is $53,000 and you can't come up to $54,000. If you can do $53,000 and offer an extra week of paid vacation each year, then I'm on board."</p>
		</li>
		<li><strong>If they do not accept your highest-priority benefit, then you move on to your second-priority benefit.</strong> To continue our example, you would say, "We're at $53,000 and you're unable to offer an extra week of paid vacation. But if you can allow me to work remotely from home two days a week, I'm on board!"
		</li>
		<li><strong>If they do not accept your second-priority benefit, you move on to your third-priority benefit.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Regardless of whether they accept your response, then you're finished. You have maximized your base salary and maximized your benefits as well.</p>

	<h2>This is a real salary negotiation script I used during a salary negotiation</h2>
	<p>I've changed the names and numbers, but this salary negotiation script example is based on a real script I used to negotiate starting salary.</p>
	<p>Here are the steps I took after receiving a verbal job offer from the hiring manager:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Asked for time to consider the offer using one of these <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/job-offer-letter-response-templates/">job offer letter response templates</a></li>
		<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-script/">Calculated my counter offer</a>.</li>
		<li>Drafted my response using this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/salary-negotiation-email-sample/">salary negotiation email template</a>.</li>
		<li>Sent the draft email to a friend to get his feedback (I can do this for you as part of a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/call/">strategy session</a>!).</li>
		<li>Edited the draft based on my friend's feedback.</li>
		<li>Sent my counter offer email to the recruiter I had been working with.</li>
		<li>Planned my salary negotiation script just like you see on this page.</li>
		<li>Had the final discussion with the recruiter where I used the script to negotiate just like you see on this page.</li>
		<li>Set my start date.</li>
		<li>Started a great new job.</li>
	</ol>
