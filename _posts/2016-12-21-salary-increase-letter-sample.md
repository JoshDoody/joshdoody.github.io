## Request your salary increase *before* you send this letter!

I recommend requesting your salary increase in person *before* you send this letter. Writing your salary increase letter ahead of time is the *perfect* way to prepare for that discussion so you're sure that your case is rock solid before you make your request.

After we go through each section of this salary increase letter, I'll walk you through the approval process that may happen behind the scenes so you have the full context for this letter.

## A section-by-section review of this salary increase letter sample

Let's walk through each section of the salary increase letter so you're comfortable with each section. You may already have everything you need to send your letter and request your salary increase. Or you may need to do some light research to fill in the blanks.

Each section below has everything you need to complete the template, so let's get started!

### 1. Address

Remember, you should send this letter *after* you have requested your salary increase from your manager. So you're addressing this letter to your manager as a follow-up to a previous conversation.

### 2. Subject

This letter is your written salary increase request, so you want everything to be as clear and obvious as possible. Include your name and explicitly state that this letter is about your salary increase request so that there are no surprises for anyone who might read it later on.

### 3. Greeting

Keep it short and sweet: "Hi Tina" will do. The bolded part is “Your manager’s name” because you're sending this written request to your manager *after* you request your salary increase.

### 4. Introduction and request (your target salary)

You have already requested your salary increase, and this is a way of reminding your manager what you requested so it's easy to find when they need to.

I recommend stating the midpoint from your [market research](TKTK_URL) *before* your target salary so that the first number is a market number—a fact that is determined by external forces—and that should soften up your manager for your request. Your request will seem much more reasonable when presented immediately after the market-set midpoint.

</div>

### 5. & 6. Accomplishments sections

This is the most important part of your salary increase letter because it clearly describes the additional, unanticipated value you have added to the company since your salary was last set. This is why you're asking for a raise, so take your time and do this right.

Include a few of your best recent accomplishments to highlight the value of your work. This letter isn’t a complete historical record of everything you’ve ever done for the company. It's a skimmable document that makes a strong case for whoever is holding the purse strings to give you a raise.

You want the person reading this to think, "They're already adding so much more value to the company then when they were hired. This seems like a totally reasonable request given all the money they have and saved us since then."

I recommend covering a reasonable amount of time—the past six to 12 months—in this section so that your case is as compelling as possible when you finally present it. If you have trouble with this section, that’s a red flag that your case may not be as strong as you anticipated, and you may not have earned as much of a raise as you thought.

</div>

### 7. & 8. Accolades sections

Accolades are awards or recognition that you've received for your work. Managers are busy people, and sometimes they won't notice the great work you do. This is your chance to let them know that *others* have noticed your great work in case they missed it.

Highlight your best results from the past six months to a year. This isn’t a complete record, it’s a skimmable list that should raise eyebrows when others see it. Remember that the person approving this raise may not know who you are, so you’re giving them a short summary of your accolades to let them know that they should be impressed with you because other people are impressed with you.

I strongly recommend you have at least a couple items in this section before you ask for your salary increase, but if your “Accomplishments” section makes a very strong case on its own, this section may not be necessary.

</div>

### 9. Conclusion and repeated request

Finish your letter with a summary of your salary increase request along with your case. This is a one-paragraph summary of your request, just in case the reader is in a hurry. Keep it to just two or three sentences.

### 10. Signoff and signature

Thank your manager for their time and keep it brief.

## What happens next?

Once you've requested your salary increase from your manager and then followed up by sending this letter, your manager will need to get approval for your raise.

The reason this salary increase letter is so important is that your manager will likely forward it to the approvers so they have all the information they need to make their decision. If you request your salary increase *without* sending this letter, then your manager will have to summarize your case for you, and they're just not going to do as good a job as you can.

So this letter gives you the opportunity to make your case *in your own words* to whoever needs to approve your request. And that gives you the greatest chance getting your salary increase.
