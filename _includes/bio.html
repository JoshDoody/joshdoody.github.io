        	<p>I'm Josh Doodyâ€”a Computer & Electrical Engineer, MBA, author, and consultant. I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. I began negotiating and <em class='u-highlight'>I doubled my salary in three years</em>.</p>
					<p>With the experience and confidence I gained from doubling my own salary, I began helping others drastically increase their salaries as well. You can read their stories in the testimonials on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials">this page</a>.</p>
					<p>I took everything I learned from my own experience and helping others and wrote <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, a #1 Best Seller on Amazon. Since I published the book at the end of 2015, <em class='u-highlight'>I've helped many more people earn tens of thousands more dollars</em>, and <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> can help you too!</p>
				  <p>I live and work in Gainesville, FL, home of the University of Florida, and you can find me at <a href="http://JoshDoody.com/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=fearlesssalarynegotiation.com&utm_campaign=nav+links&utm_content=home" target="_blank">JoshDoody.com</a>.</p>
