On average, my clients improve their job offers by $7,247.</p>
<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. I began negotiating and <strong>I doubled my salary in three years</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I use everything I learned from my own experience to help others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with <strong>Google, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft</strong>, and other companies you've probably heard of.</p>
<p>As a manager, when one of my team members asked to talk about getting a raise or promotion, I would say, "Here's what I need from you..." <strong>Get Your Next Raise</strong> is based on the process I built to collaborate with my team on how and when to pursue raises and promotions.</p>
