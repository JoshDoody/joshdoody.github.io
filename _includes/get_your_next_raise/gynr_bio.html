<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. I began negotiating and <strong>I doubled my salary in three years</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, as a hiring manager, I developed a repeatable process to help my team get the raises they deserve. You'll learn that same process in <em>Get Your Next Raise</em>.</p>
