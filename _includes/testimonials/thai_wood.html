		<p>I wanted to make sure I wasn’t leaving money on the table and that I knew what my manager and company were looking for to give me a raise. This course taught me <em>exactly</em> what I needed to know, and Josh gave great answers to all of my questions about my specific situation.</p>

		<p>Now I know that preparing for a raise is not difficult or overwhelming with the right guidance and the systemic process I learned in this course.</p>
