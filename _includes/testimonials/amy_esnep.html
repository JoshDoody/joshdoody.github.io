		<p>The $11k increase was $6k more than I expected them to renegotiate to. And the recruiter told me how great it was to have a list of all the reasons why I deserve more, so that they could send it to the appropriate people to get everything approved.</p>

		<p>Thanks for helping me get a great salary!</p>
