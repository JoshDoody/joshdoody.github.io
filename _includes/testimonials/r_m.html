		<p>I gave <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> to my sister. Sheâ€™s not a SWE, but still works in tech companies and goes through a similar interviewing process. <strong>She just started her new job today with a $50k raise over her last salary, ~$25k of that was unexpected / negotiated.</strong> Thanks, as always!</p>
