		<p>I used the materials earlier today to help counter a job offer for my wife. We used the information to get her an additional $7,000 in salary using your counter offer emails. Sheâ€™s one happy camper tonight with the additional salary that we negotiated.</p>

		<p>Thank you. I look forward to using the materials to increase my salary moving forward.</p>
