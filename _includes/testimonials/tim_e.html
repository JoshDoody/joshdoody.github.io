	<p>Letting the company name the first number led to an offer of 2x what I currently make and negotiating quickly increased it by another $10k. I was looking for more flexibility in scheduling, which didn't happen, but I felt Josh gave me the best chance of realizing that if it were an option. Knowing I gave it my best, now I can let the job go and be more confident sticking to my values and commitments in future job searches and negotiations.</p>

		<p>I would recommend hiring a salary coach in general to help people to make important decisions without putting as much stress on their families. <strong>I would recommend Josh primarily for people trying to boost their salary.</strong> I could see how Josh's methods would be very effective there â€” we were just doing something else.</p>
