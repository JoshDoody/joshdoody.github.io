  <p class="quote__text"><strong>I wanted a raise, but didn't know where to start.</strong></p><br><br>

	<p class="u-left">This course walked me through a simple process to prepare my case and ask for a raise. Each lesson had specific action items for me to make steady progress, and I got feedback on my work plus great answers to my questions every step of the way.</p>

	<p class="u-left">I needed a push and a process, and this course gave me both. I'm definitely recommending this course to my friends.</p>
