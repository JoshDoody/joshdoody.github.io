		<p>I work as an inside sales rep and I was offered $22/hour to move to a comparable job at a competitor. After asking for a couple of days to review and then using the <strong>Standard Counter Offer Email Template</strong> to counter with $27/hour, they came back with $24.50.</p>
		
		<p><strong>This represents $7,000 more annually</strong> than they were offering initially for a 50 hour week!</p>
		
		<p>Big win, thank you, The Salary Negotiation Crash Course totally worked!</p>
