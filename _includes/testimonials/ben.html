		<p>In the end, <strong>the most impactful thing Josh did was a line in a two-paragraph email</strong> that essentially said, "Instead of $211k per year, I want $250k."<strong> That doesn't seem like I paid for much!</strong></p>

		<p>However, there's a lot of things that went into that email. <strong>Where do we want to pressure them? Which dimensions do we want to go on?</strong> It was knowing the correct things to ask for (cash or equity), knowing the correct amount to ask for, and knowing how to come up with a narrative around why they should try to reach my number. That email wasn't just a number, it was a story.</p>
