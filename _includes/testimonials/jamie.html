		<p style="text-align: center !important;"><strong>Negotiating job offers at Facebook, Amazon, GitHub and Stripe</strong></p>
		
		<p>I was unsure about negotiation strategy and how aggressive to be. <strong>I was also experiencing a lot of angst about which opportunity was right for me</strong> — which one was a good values fit, which one I would actually be happiest in, what they would actually be willing to pay me and how much that even mattered.</p>
		
		<p>You have a lot of time to overthink things during the negotiation process. Josh helped keep my nervousness to a minimum and helped me feel confident about the tone that I was setting in my interactions with different companies.</p>
		
		<p>The offers got close enough to each other that I could decide based on other more intangible factors. <strong>I think without Josh's help, I wouldn't have been able to narrow that gap and be able to even think about the ultimately more important factors</strong> of where I actually want to work, what I want to devote my efforts to, what I want the next chapter of my career to be oriented around. <strong>I was able to choose the opportunity that was the most compelling for me personally.</strong></p>
