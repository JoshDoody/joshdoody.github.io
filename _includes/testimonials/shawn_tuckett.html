    <p class="quote__text"><strong>I was skeptical of the high price, but with just a couple short conversations, I got a $17,000 raise!</strong></p><br><br>

		<p class="u-left">This coaching isnâ€™t cheap, and I already owned <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, so I knew the process to ask for a raise. But even though I knew I should be paid more and I knew the process, I kept running into road blocks with my boss.</p>

		<p class="u-left">I wanted help for my specific situation, and I needed a push to make a plan and see it through, so I decided to give this coaching a try.</p>

		<p class="u-left">What a great decision! Josh helped me formulate a solid plan, and he gave me quick feedback as we talked through different scenarios and possible outcomes so I knew exactly what to expect and how to react. </p>

		<p class="u-left">With just a couple short conversations, I got a $17,000 raise and I could finally stop worrying about whether I was underpaid.</p>

		<p class="u-left">I recommend this coaching because salary negotiations are important, and going it alone is risky when you can have expert guidance on your side.</p>
