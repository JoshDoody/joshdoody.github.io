I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. <strong>I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.</strong></p>
<p>With the experience and confidence I gained from doubling my own salary, I began helping others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with companies like <strong>Google, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM</strong>, and  other companies you've probably heard of. You can read their stories on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials" target="_blank">testimonials page</a>.</p>
<p>I took everything I learned from my own experience and helping others and wrote <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>. So you can learn the same strategy and tactics I have used to help my clients earn hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
