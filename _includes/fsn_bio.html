<p>I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. I began negotiating and <strong>I doubled my salary in three years</strong>.</p>
<p>Now I use everything I learned from my own experience to help others make tens of thousands more dollars negotiating with <strong>Google, Amazon, Tesla, @WalmartLabs, Kimberly-Clark, Bloomberg, Red Hat, Verizon, IBM, Microsoft</strong>, and other companies you've heard of.</p>
<p>You can learn my strategy and tactics with my book, <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation: A step-by-step guide to getting paid what you're worth</em>.</p>
