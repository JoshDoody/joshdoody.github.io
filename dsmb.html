	<p>The Interview Cheat Sheet is an example of a digital product that I built and shipped in about a week. I initially launched it at $9, then raised the price to $14. I sold it for about six months before I realized it was the perfect thing to give away to help new readers get immediate value, so I started giving it away. 
		
	<p>To give you some perspective, here's the Product Hunt page, and the landing page here on my site:</p>

	</ul>
