	<h2>You could be asking for a raise in 30 days</h2>
	<p>The <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> process for getting a raise is simple. But <em>knowing</em> the process and <em>doing</em> the process are two different things. If you just keep putting it off and waiting until later, you may never follow through.</p>
	<p>Waiting just six months to get a $5,000 raise, that will cost you $2,500.</p>
	
	<h2>This class will cost <s>$500</s> $250 when you join the first group in September</h2>
	<p>Hundreds of people have read <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> and taken the video courses. And I've worked with many people 1-on-1 to walk them through this process with great results. Now I'm offering the same process and coaching in a group format.</p>
	<p>I'll be refining the process and learning what works for you as we go, so I'm offering this first class for only $250.</p>
