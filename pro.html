      <p><strong>Salary negotiation can be intimidating.</strong> There’s a lot on the line and every situation is unique. Plus, there are so many questions that it can feel overwhelming.</p>
      <ul class="checkbox-list">
        <li class="checkbox-list__item">Are you paid what you’re worth?</li>
				<li class="checkbox-list__item">Should you negotiate your salary?</li>
				<li class="checkbox-list__item">What do you say when they ask you for your current or desired salary?</li>
				<li class="checkbox-list__item">What if you negotiate and they pull the job offer?</li>
				<li class="checkbox-list__item">How do you ask for a raise?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It can be easy to just throw your hands up in frustration and avoid the topic completely. But then you could be leaving many thousands of dollars on the table over the course of your career.</p>

      <h2 class='section-heading header--centered section-heading--with-line'>What if I told you there’s a simple method you can use to increase your salary and earn thousands more dollars?</h2>
		</div>
    <div class="container container--normal">
			<p>You can use it to maximize your salary when you change jobs <em>and</em> you can use it to increase your salary and get promoted at your existing job.</p>
			<p>The best part? You can use this method over and over throughout your career—it’s easy and repeatable.</p>
			<p>If you could negotiate a $5,000 increase next time you change jobs or at your current job, you would make $5,000 more that first year. And you would make $5,000 the next year, and the next year, and the next year. <em class='u-highlight'>Over 20 years, that $5,000 salary increase would be worth more than $100,000.</em> That’s a lot of money to leave on the table due to frustration or fear.</p>

      <h2 class='section-heading header--centered section-heading--with-line'>I know you probably have a lot of questions. So here are some common questions and answers.</h2>
		</div>
    <div class="container container--normal">
			<p><strong>Will <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> work for <em>you</em>?</strong> <em class='u-highlight'>Yes.</em> If you’re an experienced executive or if you’re a recent college grad looking for your first full-time job, <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> will help you negotiate a higher salary.</p>
			<p>Not convinced? Here are testimonials from Josh C., a Senior Business Development Executive, and Harrison, a recent college grad:</p>

			<p><strong>What if you don’t need <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> right now?</strong> Remember that example above where you negotiated $5,000 more in base salary and that added up to more than $100,000 over the next 20 years of your career? <em class='u-highlight'>If you wait just one year, then that same $5,000 is only worth $95,000 over the next 20 years.</em> Wait two years and that same $5,000 increase is only worth $90,000 over the next 20 years. The sooner you start negotiating your salary like a pro, the more money you will make over the course of your career.</p>
			<p><strong>I don’t have time for this right now.</strong> That’s not a question! But I’ll answer it anyway. ;) <em class='u-highlight'>You can read <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> cover to cover in about 4 hours on a Saturday afternoon.</em> I'll even send you short daily emails with one key takeaway from each chapter for the first week after you buy. The courses are about three hours total, so you could knock those out on Sunday afternoon. I don’t like fluff, so <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> is a lean guide full of tactics and light on fluff.</p>
			<p>Justin didn’t even read the whole book—he just skimmed two chapters—and he made another $11,000.</p>

			<p><strong>I'm Josh Doody</strong>—a Computer & Electrical Engineer, MBA, author, and consultant. I didn't negotiate my salary at my first few jobs, but quickly realized I had left a lot of money on the table. I began negotiating and I doubled my salary in three years.</p>
			<p>With the experience and confidence I gained from doubling my own salary, I began helping others drastically increase their salaries as well. You can read their stories on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials" target="_blank">testimonials page</a>.</p>
			<p>I took everything I learned from my own experience and helping others and wrote <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, a #1 Best Seller on Amazon. Since I published the book at the end of 2015, I've helped many more people earn tens of thousands more dollars, and Fearless Salary Negotiation can help you too!</p>
