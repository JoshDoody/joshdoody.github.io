  <h2>What if I'm not ready?</h2>
	<p>Fair question! Promotions <em>seem</em> like things that are granted to us by companies when they feel like it. But the reality is <em class='u-highlight'>you don’t need to wait for a promotion to come to you</em>.</p>
	<p>Here are some common reasons we talk ourselves out of asking for that promotion, along with my response for each one—many of these may sound familiar:</p>
  <ul class="question-list">
		<li class="question-list__item"><strong>I don't even know how to ask for a promotion. Do I ask in person? Through email?</strong> You will start by asking in person, then follow up with an email. I'll walk you through both!</li>		
    <li class="question-list__item"><strong>What if my manager says no?</strong> I’m going to help you put together a very strong case to minimize this possibility. But even if your manager does say no, that’s ok because you can still say, “Ok, I understand. Can you help me understand why I’m not ready for a promotion so I know what to work on?”</li>		
    <li class="question-list__item"><strong>Do I deserve a promotion?</strong> It’s not about the time you put in, but the value you add to your company. I will help you demonstrate that you've earned a promotion.</li>
	  <li class="question-list__item"><strong>Do I just need to work harder and harder until I get a promotion?</strong> It would be nice if it were this simple, but this just isn’t how companies work.</li>		
	  <li class="question-list__item"><strong>Don’t I have to wait until my next performance review?</strong> Nope!</li>		
	</ul>
	<p>You can do this, and I'll walk you through it step-by-step in this free course on how to get promoted at work!</p>
