        <h2 class='section-heading'>What if I'm not ready?</h2>
				<p>Fair question! Promotions <em>seem</em> like things that are granted to us by companies when they feel like it. But the reality is <em class='u-highlight'>you don’t need to wait for a promotion to come to you</em>.</p>
				<p>Here are some common reasons we talk ourselves out of asking for that promotion, along with my response for each one—many of these may sound familiar:</p>
    <ul class="checkbox-list">
      <li class="checkbox-list__item"><em class='u-highlight'>I don't even know how to ask for a promotion.</em> Do I ask in person? Through email? You will start by asking in person, then follow up with an email. I'll walk you through both!</li>		
      <li class="checkbox-list__item"><em class='u-highlight'>What if my manager says no?</em> I’m going to help you put together a very strong case to minimize this possibility. But even if your manager does say no, that’s ok because you can still say, “Ok, I understand. Can you help me understand why I’m not ready for a promotion so I know what to work on?”</li>		
      <li class="checkbox-list__item"><em class='u-highlight'>Do I deserve a promotion?</em> It’s not about the time you put in, but the value you add to your company. I will help you demonstrate that you've earned a promotion.</li>
		  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><em class='u-highlight'>Do I just need to work harder and harder until I get a promotion?</em> It would be nice if it were this simple, but this just isn’t how companies work.</li>		
		  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><em class='u-highlight'>Don’t I have to wait until my next performance review?</em> Nope!</li>		
		</ul>
		<p>You can do this, and I'll walk you through it step-by-step in this free course!</p>
