A raise is more than just getting paid more money. It’s a way for the company to compensate you for additional value you are adding—additional responsibilities, skillset or market value—since your salary was last set.

That’s great, but what do you do with that information?

Knowing what a raise *is* will guide you on how to ask for one in a way that makes sense *to the company*.

Let’s start with how *not* to ask for a raise.

> “I need more money to pay for my new BMW.”

That’s a great example of how *not* to ask for a raise. You probably knew that when you read it, but let’s break it down so you can see how bad that strategy really is.

There are two big problems with this request.

### 1. There’s no goal

“I need more money” is vague. But your paycheck is a specific number, and *someone* will have decide how much of a raise you get if you get that far. By making a vague request, you’re forcing your manager or someone else to do the hard work of figuring out how much of a raise to give you. The harder it is to figure out what you want, the less likely they are to work with you.

### 2. The reason is all wrong

How does a fancy new BMW affect the business that writes the paychecks? It doesn’t. Remember, the company’s goal is to make money. Driving a new BMW probably doesn’t help them do that.

Here’s what that request would sound like to a manager:

> “I would like an indeterminate amount of money to help me pay for a thing that has nothing to do with helping the company make money.”

Yikes.

At most companies things like raises and promotions are approved by higher-ups that you may never meet, but they’re *facilitated* by the same person almost everywhere: your manager.

That means your manager is your *partner* in the raise and promotion process. You *have to* work with them, so you should make their job as easy as possible and hand them your raise request on a silver platter with everything they need to get it approved.

## The ingredients of a good raise request

So what do they need? Three things.

### 1. A specific amount

Instead of vaguely asking for more money, ask for a raise to a specific amount. This will make it much easier for your manager to work with you to get your raise approved or discuss a different amount that might be more achievable.

### 2. Specific reasons

You need to make a *business case* to justify your request. That means describing the additional value you’re adding to the company since your salary was last set.

### 3. Social proof

Managers are busy people, so they may not notice all the benefits of the work you do. Help them out by telling them what other people have said about your work.

## A better way to ask for a raise

Let’s take this new perspective and rephrase the bad raise request from earlier. Remember, it was:

> “I need more money to pay for my new BMW.”

Here’s a better way to ask for a raise:

> “I would like to talk about raising my salary to $75,000. I’m managing twice as many projects as I was last time I got a raise, and our biggest client just emailed our team to say how happy they are with my work.”

That’s *much* better! There’s a lot more to a good raise request, but this is a great start.

So now you’re ready to ask for a raise, right? Well, not quite! They say timing is everything, and that’s true for raises as well.
