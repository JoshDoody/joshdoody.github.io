In the last article, you heard [how Shawn got a $17,000 raise with just a couple conversations]({{ site.baseurl }}/free-raise-course/how-shawn-got-a-big-raise/). But you might be wondering, “What if they say *no* when I ask for a raise?”

It would be great if you could always get a raise by asking for one, but that’s just not how it works. So here is how to plan your next step for each of the three most common answers to your raise request.

## 1. When they say *yes*. (Yay!)

This is what you’re hoping for. But even if you get a raise, don’t take your foot off the gas pedal—it’s never too early to start planning your next move.

You may need to pursue a promotion so you have more room to get big raises in the future. Or you could start building your case for your *next* raise so you know exactly what you need to accomplish before your next opportunity comes up.

Wait a year or so before asking for another big raise, but start building your case *now*.

## 2. When they say *not yet*.

This isn’t the result you’re hoping for, but it’s still a good result! This usually means that your case isn’t quite strong enough yet or that there’s not enough budget to accommodate your request.

Work with your manager to make a plan and determine a timeline. *What* do you need to accomplish to justify your request, and *when* should you revisit the raise conversation?

## 3. When they say *no* and there’s no plan or timeline to make it happen.

This might happen several reasons, and they’re often out of your control. Maybe the company isn’t healthy enough to pay people more. Maybe they’re moving in a different direction so that your skillset isn’t as valuable as it might be elsewhere.

This is still a *useful* outcome because now you *know* something you may have suspected for a while: a raise wasn’t available to you in your current situation. Now you know for sure!

*How important is a raise?*

If it’s very important to you, then it might be time to start looking for other opportunities, possibly at other companies, where your work is valued and there’s budget available to pay you for the value you bring.

Or maybe you really like your job for non-monetary reasons, and a raise would’ve just been icing on the cake. In that case, you might stay put, but at least you’ll be making a conscious decision to work where your pay likely won’t keep up with your contributions.

## Getting to one of these outcomes is your goal

Not all of these outcomes are “ideal”, but they are all *useful* for your career. You should manage the things you can control and then use all the information available to make your next decision. When it comes to asking for a raise, you can’t *necessarily* control the result. But you can control your own performance and build a case to reflect the value you add, and you can control the timing—*when* you ask for a raise.

Manage the things you can control and give yourself the best chance at a good result. Proactively pursuing raises and promotions by following a sound process is the best way to manage your career so you get the most opportunities and maximize your earning potential.
