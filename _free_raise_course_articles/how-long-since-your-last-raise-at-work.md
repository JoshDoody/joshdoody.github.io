This might sound familiar…

Every Monday you start a new work week. You check your email, review your calendar, and plan for all your big meetings. Then you have a quiet moment and that same old thought creeps in:

**What’s next?**

You’ve had that thought every week for months, and every week you find the same answer:

**I’ll figure it out next week.**

Then you go back to checking your email, reviewing your calendar, and getting ready for all those meetings. The same emails. The same schedule. The same meetings. The same job. The same paycheck. It’s all the same.

**How long has it been?**

How long has it been since your last raise? How many Mondays have you done this routine?

Probably more than you would like. But you know what? Most people feel that way! And they know they should probably do something about it, but what? And when? And how?

There are so many questions and so many unknowns that it’s easier to just kick the can down the road and check another email.

The *real* problem is that you don’t know where to start, and this series will help you do something about that.

We'll start from the beginning—what is a raise, *really*?—and take it from there. You’ll learn how companies think about raises and promotions, how to pick the best time to make a move, what happens if they say “no”, and you’ll even hear a case study about one of my students who got a $17,000 raise with just a few short conversations.

In this series, you’ll gain a whole new perspective on raises and promotions, and you’ll see that you can take control of this process.

In the next article, [“What is a raise, REALLY?”]({{ site.baseurl }}/free-raise-course/salary-raise-definition/), we’ll answer a basic question that many people struggle to answer.
