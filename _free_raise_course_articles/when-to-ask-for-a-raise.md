It would be great if having a strong case—a specific goal with good reasons and social proof—was all you needed to get your next raise. A strong case *is* important, but there's another crucial ingredient: *timing*.

*When* you ask is just as important as *what* you ask for, so here's how you know *when* you should ask for a raise.

## Does everyone gets reviewed at the same time?

If there’s a company-wide “performance review cycle” where everyone gets reviews and raises at the same time, that’s probably not a good time to get a big raise.

Why? Because there's probably a single budget that gets divvied up for the whole company. So the company has a budget for merit increases, and each department gets some amount of that budget, and each manager gets some smaller amount of that budget for their team.

Since there’s a fixed budget that's spread pretty thin, there’s not very much money available for any one person to get a raise. For you to get a big raise, someone else has to get a smaller raise or possibly no raise at all.

Most managers don't want to choose who gets a raise and who doesn't, so they'll stick to the standard raise.

**If everyone gets reviewed at the same time, ask for a raise about six months from the common performance review cycle.** If everyone gets performance reviews in January, you should ask for a raise in July. If everyone gets reviewed in July, you should ask for a raise in January.

That's when there's most likely to be money for exceptional merit increases.

## What if everyone gets reviewed based on anniversary date or as needed?

This one is a little easier: **If everyone gets reviewed based on anniversary date or as needed, you can ask for a raise when your case is strong enough.**

Then there’s generally not a big fixed budget and “big” raises are handled on an individual basis. That means you aren’t competing with everyone else in the company to get a raise, so taking advantage of *your* performance review to ask for a raise can be effective.

## So how do you know when you should ask for a raise?

The best time to ask for a raise is when there’s budget available *and* you're ready to make a strong case that your current salary doesn't reflect the value you're adding to the company. You have the most control over building your case, so start there. But make sure you're looking ahead for the next good opportunity to ask for a raise so you can have a strong case ready to go when the timing is right.

## A case study

Now you know how to build your case and ask for a raise at the right time. But wouldn’t it be great to see an example of this process in action? Of course it would!
