All that‚Äôs great, but wouldn‚Äôt it be better to see a real example of this whole process put to use? Yes it would!

## How Shawn got a $17,000 raise with a couple short conversations

Shawn is a [real person]({{ site.baseurl }}/testimonials#shawn_tuckett) so I‚Äôm withholding some details out of respect for his privacy. I can tell you that Shawn made $17,000 by following this process, but I‚Äôve decided not to tell you what his salary actually is.

Ok! Let‚Äôs get to the story!

Shawn had been at his software and services company for about seven years. He started there right out of grad school, learned the business, and worked his way up to Senior Director of Sales and Service.

But his salary didn‚Äôt move up with him. He brought this up with his managers a few times, but never got anywhere. There was always something‚Äìan expensive development contract, a big client falling through‚Äîthat had to be taken care of first. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about it later this year‚Äù was something Shawn heard more than once.

So he reached out and asked if I could help. Of course I could!

## Our plan

Shawn needed a strong case showing the value he brought to the company, and he needed to know the best time to ask for a raise. If we presented a strong case at the right time, then we would short-circuit most of the knee-jerk objections managers often give to raise requests and shift the focus of the conversation to the value Shawn brought to his role at the company and what his compensation should be for that role.

Setting Shawn‚Äôs target salary

The first thing we needed to know was, ‚ÄúWhat *should* Shawn be paid?‚Äù

We started by looking into what a Director of Sales and Service might make at other companies similar to Shawn‚Äôs. We would use this number as a baseline when we set Shawn‚Äôs target salary.

Through a combination of sites like [salary.com](http://salary.com) and industry contacts, Shawn was able to determine that he could be making quite a bit more money doing the same job at other similar companies. It seemed like $15,000‚Äì$20,000 more was in the ballpark.

## Building his case

We also looked at valuable responsibilities he had taken on since the last time his salary was set. We needed to confirm that Shawn was driving more revenue for the business and find specific examples where he had done that.

He was managing more of the business, closing and re-signing key accounts, and had built processes to help make Sales and Service more efficient and more profitable for the company. For example, Shawn created an inside sales program to identify current client needs and proactively introduce new product features to meet them and increase revenue. He also created a new services offering for the company to take over manual work previously done by the clients.

Both of these initiatives created valuable new revenue streams for the company.

It was clear that our initial goal of a $15,000‚Äì$20,000 raise was still about right. And some of the activities could be tied to a specific value to the company, so that would help us demonstrate that Shawn‚Äôs work had directly led to more revenue and profit.

## Finding the right time

There was no company-wide performance review time, which meant he just needed to focus on asking for a raise when the company was likely to have budget available to grant his request. So we considered the next several months, looking for times when the company was likely to have either greater revenue or reduced costs so that there might be budget available.

They had contracted with a software developer to do some custom work, and that contract would end in about two months. There wasn‚Äôt currently any plan to renew that contract, so that was our opportunity.

## The plan

We decided Shawn would ask for a $20,000 raise about a month before the developer contract was ending. That way the company could earmark some of the cost of that contract to go to Shawn‚Äôs increased salary before releasing that budget for other projects.

## How‚Äôd it go?

Shawn had his first conversation with his manager about a month before the end of that developer contract. He was ready with his specific request and had a strong case to demonstrate he was adding a lot more value to the company now than when his salary was last set.

His managers said, ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt prepared to do this right now. Let us talk it over and regroup next week.‚Äù Not what Shawn was hoping for, but not a bad result. So Shawn followed up his conversation with a written summary of his case, emphasizing the value he brought to the company.

Over the next several days, he reviewed his case so he knew it inside and out. Reviewing his case was important because it gave him confidence to present it with authority‚Äîhe *knew* he was much more valuable than his salary indicated, and he just needed to make sure his managers knew that too.

The next time they spoke, Shawn re-emphasized his case, focusing on the additional value he brought to his role since his salary was last adjusted. His manager agreed that it was time to adjust his salary, and they increased his salary by $17,000 effective immediately.

**"That's great for Shawn! But what if they say no when *I* ask for a raise?"**

I bet you didn't know I could read minds! üòâ
