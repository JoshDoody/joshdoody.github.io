This seems pretty obvious, right? “A raise is when you get paid more money at work.” Like this:

Thanks for reading!

Just kidding! There’s a follow-up question that makes things a little more complicated:

> ***Why?***

As in, “Why would a company pay you more money?” That question makes things a little more interesting, so let’s dig in a little bit.

### Companies exist to make money

First things first: most companies exist to make money, so virtually everything they do is to achieve that goal. Sales, marketing, advertising, product development and—you guessed it!—hiring.

The last time your salary was set—six months ago, a year ago, two years ago—your company had certain expectations about the responsibilities you would handle in exchange for your paycheck. As long as you continue doing those same things, your value to the company probably won't change very much. And that means your paycheck probably won't change very much.

### Greater responsibilities, skillset, and market value are the key

So if they do pay you more money—if they give you a raise—then your skillset and experience are probably *more valuable* to the company than your previous salary indicated.

Ok! Now we’re getting somewhere! So a raise isn’t just “when you get paid more money at work”.

***A raise is a way for the company to compensate you for additional value you are adding—additional responsibilities, skillset or market value—since your salary was last set.***

Let's update our picture from earlier so it's more accurate:

<p class='u-center'><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gifs/YourPayAndResponsibilities.gif" alt="Your pay reflects your increased responsibility" style="display: block; width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; border: 1px solid #555;"/></p>

We could draw the same picture with "skillset" or "market value" up top. If you improve your skillset—for example, you go back to school to get your MBA or some other degree that directly contributes to your job—you may be better equipped to help the company make money. Or if the job market changes so that your skillset is in higher demand now than it was when you initially took your job, then you're probably more valuable to your company.

This is a new way to think about getting a raise. It means you can take a different approach than most people do because you know why your company would pay you more money. So instead of just waiting for someone to offer you a raise, you can proactively identify the additional value you add to the company and ask for a raise to compensate you for it.

How do you do that? In the next article, [How NOT to ask for a raise]({{ site.baseurl }}/free-raise-course/how-not-to-ask-for-a-raise/), I'll tell you how to use this new definition of a raise to ask for one.
