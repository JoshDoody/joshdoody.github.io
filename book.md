Most salary negotiation guides are a big collection of articles. They're good for digging into a *particular* topic, but you have to pick and choose the best article each time.

It would be so much easier read a guide designed to walk you through the entire salary negotiation process step-by-step. That's why I wrote *Fearless Salary Negotiation*, which quickly became a #1 Best Seller on Amazon. It's a step-by-step guide that walks you through every phase of the interview and salary negotiation processes, and it's packed with specific tactics so you always know what to do next.

## Read the ultimate salary negotiation guide for free

***Fearless Salary Negotiation* is *the* ultimate salary negotiation guide**, and you can read it here for free.

If you decide to buy the [book]({{ site.baseurl }}/#basic), [courses]({{ site.baseurl }}/video-courses/) or [coaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/coach/), you can do that any time. If you prefer to skim the book online, you can do that too.

## Why are you giving this away for free?

I like [helping people]({{ site.bsaeurl }}/testimonials/), and this is another way I can help people by making sure everyone has access to my book.

## How do you make money if you're giving it away?

Some people will be happy reading the book for free online, and others are happy to pay for more. Some will want to read it on their [Kindle or in iBooks]({{ site.baseurl }}/#basic). Some will want the worksheets and email templates that come with [the book]({{ site.baseurl }}/#basic). Some will want [self-paced courses]({{ site.baseurl }}/video-courses/) to really master the material. 

And for those considering [1-on-1 coaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/coach/) for accountability and a customized plan, this is a great way to show them that I know what I'm talking about.

My book is the *foundation* for everything else I offer, and those other things are very valuable.

## Why would I buy it if I can get it here for free?

<ul class="checkbox-list">
  <li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Convenience.</strong> I've tried to make the online version of <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> easy to read and navigate, but it's still a collection of web pages. When you buy <a href="/#basic">The Basic Edition</a> or any of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/video-courses/">video course editions</a>, you can download the eBook to your own eReader where you can read offline, take notes, and own the book. When you buy the video course editions, you can download the video courses and you own them forever.</li>
	<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Worksheets.</strong> Several of the chapters have companion worksheets that you get when you buy the book. Those worksheets will help you get better results (more money).</li>
	<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Email templates.</strong> Several of the chapters have email templates, which are hard to replicate from an HTML page. When you buy the book, you also get your own editable copy of those templates so you can use them yourself and get better results (more money).</li>
	<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Case studies.</strong> When you buy the book, you get case studies that are real stories from real people about how they negotiated a higher salary.</li> 
	<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Future updates.</strong> I will continue to add things to the book that you will only get when you buy it from me. For example, I'm currently recording the audiobook and making printable checklists to accompany each chapter so you get better results (more money—are you sensing a theme yet?). You'll only get those if you have bought the book.</li>
</ul>
