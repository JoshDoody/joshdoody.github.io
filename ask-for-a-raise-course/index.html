	<!--p>You optimize every system you can, tweaking each line until its just right, but are you doing the same for your salary? Most devs I know are underpaid because they either don't know their value or they don't know where to start when it comes to asking for a raise or promotion. This 30-day class will help you know your value and plan for your next raise or promotion to optimize your salary.</p-->

		<strong>(Coming November 29!)</strong>
	</p>
	
	<p>Every Monday you start a new work week. You check your email, review your calendar, and plan for all your big meetings. Then you have a quiet moment and that same old thought creeps in:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>What's next?</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>You've had that thought every week for <em>months</em>, and every week you find the same answer:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>I'll figure it out next week.</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>Then you go back to checking your email, reviewing your calendar, and getting ready for all those meetings. The same emails. The same schedule. The same meetings. The same job. The same paycheck. It's all the same.</p>

<div class="container container--normal">
	<h2>How many weeks has it been?</h2>
	
	<p>How many weeks has it been since you first thought, "What's next?" All those weeks with a smaller paycheck than you could've gotten.</p>
		
	<p>What if you could go back in time to that first Monday when this thought first crept in and <em>do something about it</em> right then? Where would you be right now?</p>
	
	<p>There are three possibilities—all of them are good for your long-term career:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>You could already be there</strong>, at the next level <em>doing</em> your new job and <em>collecting</em> that bigger paycheck—$50 a week, $100 a week, $200 a week, or more.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be executing a plan with a clear timeline</strong> that you and your manager put together to get you to the next level. You would be making progress, not sitting still.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be looking ahead to better opportunities</strong> if the raise or promotion you feel you've earned simply isn't available to you at your current company.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>But you haven't even <em>started</em> doing something about it yet. So could be leaving money on the table every week while your career stagnates.</p>
		
	<h2>Why haven't you started?</h2>
	
	<p>That's the question, isn't it? If you're literally leaving money on the table every time you get a paycheck, then what's holding you back?</p>
	
	<p>Maybe you don't know <em>where</em> to start or <em>what</em> to do. "I want a raise." or "I want a promotion." isn't a plan, it's a dream. But you don't need a dream, you need a plan.</p>
	
	<h2>This is your plan</h2>
	<p>The <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> process for getting a raise or promotion is simple. But <em>knowing</em> the process and <em>doing</em> the process are two different things. If you just keep putting it off and waiting until later, you may never follow through.</p>
	<p>Waiting just six months to get a $5,000 raise will cost you $2,500—that's <em>ten times</em> the cost of this course!</p>
	
	<p>Hundreds of people have read <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> and taken the video courses. And I've worked with many people 1-on-1 to walk them through this process with great results. Now I'm offering the same process as self-paced, interactive course for only <s>$247</s> $197 when you pre-order.</p>

	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>This course will help you set your goal and build your case for your next raise or promotion. You'll work at your own pace—as quickly or casually as you like—and get answers to questions and feedback directly from me on your progress.</p>
	<h3>Checkins, action items, feedback, progress</h3>
	<ul class="checkbox-list">
		<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Each module has a checkpoint to learn about the goal for that module.</strong> As you move through the course and complete action items, the next module will become available.</li>

		<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>Regular feedback on your action items.</strong> For each module, I will give you feedback on your progress and offer suggestions to improve the case you're building.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>You'll also get...</h3>
	<ul class="checkbox-list">
		<li class="checkbox-list__item"><strong>The Raise and Promotion Bundle of <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> (an $89 value).</strong> That includes the eBook, worksheets, email templates, and three video courses you can use to reinforce what you learn in this course throughout your career.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Course curriculum</h2>
	<ul class="checkbox-list">

	</ul>
	
	<h2>Common questions and answers</h2>
	<p><strong>How long does this take?</strong></p>
	<p>Each of the six modules is designed to take 30–60 minutes. Your total time invested will probably be about 4–5 hours.</p>
	<p>The course is self-paced, so you can move through the modules as quickly or leisurely as you like. You could easily complete the course in a day or two, or take your time over a few weeks.</p>
		
	<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
	<p>Here's a high-level summary of the cadence for each of the six modules:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Watch the module video lesson</li>
		<li>Get action items for that module</li>
		<li>Review short, supplementary video lessons as needed</li>
		<li>Complete the module's action items using the included templates and worksheets</li>
		<li>Get my feedback or input on your progress</li>
		<li>Move on to the next module when you're ready</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each module has a video lesson where we define your goals for that module, cover the background and details you need to complete the module's action tiems, and assign the module's action items.</p>
	<p>Each module also has short supplementary lessons so you can review topics or dive deeper as needed.</p>
	<p>Then you'll complete the module's action items, ask me any questions you have, and even get my feedback on your progress if you like.</p>
	<p>Once you're comfortable with that module and have completed the action items, you can move to the next module when you're ready or you'll be automatically moved to the next lesson after two weeks.</p>
	
	<p><strong>What does "self-paced" mean?</strong></p>
	<p>You can move as quickly or slowly as you like, and the course will help you keep moving. You will always be able to request the next module whenever you're ready, so if you want to cruise through the entire course in one sitting, you can do that.</p>
	<p>If you want to pace yourself, ask questions, and get my feedback as you go, you can do that too. I'll email you a few days after you begin the module to see how things are going and encourage you to keep moving. After two weeks, you'll automatically move to the next module so you're encouraged to keep moving toward your goal.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Will this course help me get a promotion, or just a raise?</strong></p>
	<p>We'll cover raises <em>and</em> promotions! If you're ready for your next raise, promotion, or both, this course will help you get there.</p>	
	
	<h2>1-year Money Back Guarantee</h2>
	<p>I guarantee you will be satisfied with this course or <strong>I will happily refund your money for one year</strong>. And the included <strong>Raise and Promotion Bundle</strong> book and video course are yours to keep.</p>
