    <p><strong>You should negotiate starting salary</strong> rather than just accepting the first job offer you get. But how?</p>
    <p>I wrote <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}"><em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em></a> to help people get paid what their worth. And my method to negotiate starting salary is easy to use while generating phenomenal results. <em class='u-highlight'>That's why it's a #1 Best Seller on Amazon.</em></p>
    <p><strong>You need two things to successfuly negotiate starting salary</strong></p>
    <ul class="checkbox-list">
      <li class="checkbox-list__item">A strong counteroffer</li>
      <li class="checkbox-list__item">A detailed plan to negotiate once you deliver your counteroffer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em class='u-highlight'>This page will calculate your counteroffer for you</em>, and the detailed sample script shows you how to negotiate starting salary once you've delivered that counteroffer.</p>
    <p>You're about 1 minute away from having a complete salary negotiation script to successfuly negotaiate starting salary!</p>

      <p><strong>Once you've countered, the company will probably respond with something between your job offer and your counteroffer.</strong> That's your negotiation window. Your goal is to maximize your salary within that window.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container container--grid">

      <p>In this example the company has made <em class='u-highlight'>an offer of $50,000</em>, and <em class='u-highlight'>you have countered at $56,000</em>. Your <em class='u-highlight'>negotiation window is now $50,000–$56,000</em>. This sample salary negotiation script is your plan for hashing out the final details of your compensation package in the Final Discussion by <em>first</em> maximizing your base salary and <em>then</em> negotiating for additional benefits.</p>

      <p>(Your Minimum Acceptable Salary is the underlined row.)</p>

      <h3><u>$56,000</u> (Counter)</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li><strong>$55,000</strong> - Sounds good, when do I start?</li>
	<li><strong>$54,000</strong> - $55,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
	<li><strong>$53,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
	<li><u><strong>$52,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</u></li>
	<li><strong>$51,000</strong> - I can't accept less than $52,000.</li>

      <h3><u>$50,000</u> (Offer)</h3>

      <p><strong>How to use this script</strong></p>

      <p>The company will discuss your counter internally and determine how much they can pay you. Then you will often have a quick phone call with the recruiter or hiring manager to determine your final salary and other benefits.</p>

      <p>When the company responds to your counter, <em class='u-highlight'>use this script to maximize your starting salary and benefits</em>. For each step, if they accept your proposal, then you're finished. If they don't accept your proposal, go to the next step.</p>
      
      <ol>
	<li><strong>Use the first statement as your first response.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $55,000, you'll say, "Sounds good, when do I start?" If the company comes back with $54,000, you'll say, "$55,000 and I'm on board!"
	</li>
	<li><p><strong>If they do not accept your first response, take the current salary as your base and request your highest-priority benefit.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $53,000, then you say "If you can do $54,000, I'm on board!"</p>
	  <p>If they stick with $53,000, then you would say, "I understand the best you can do is $53,000 and you can't come up to $54,000. If you can do $53,000 and offer an extra week of paid vacation each year, then I'm on board."</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>If they do not accept your highest-priority benefit, then you move on to your second-priority benefit.</strong> To continue our example, you would say, "We're at $53,000 and you're unable to offer an extra week of paid vacation. But if you can allow me to work remotely from home two days a week, I'm on board!"
	</li>
	<li><strong>If they do not accept your second-priority benefit, you move on to your third-priority benefit.</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Regardless of whether they accept your response, then you're finished. You have maximized your base salary and maximized your benefits as well.</p>
