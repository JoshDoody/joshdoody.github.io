    <h2 class='section-heading section-heading--with-line'>2. Deliver your counteroffer</h2>
    <p><strong>Now that you have your counteroffer calculated, you need to deliver it to the recruiter or hiring manager.</p>
  </div>
	
  <div class="container container--grid">

    <p><em class='u-highlight'>If possible, deliver your counteroffer in an email.</em> Why? So that you can also make your case to justify your counteroffer and so your written case can be circulated internally at the company if they need to discuss it.</p>
    <p><strong>Components of a strong case for your counteroffer</strong></p>

    <p>Here are a few things to include with your counteroffer to make your case as strong as possible:</p>
    <ul class="checkbox-list">
      <li class="checkbox-list__item">Your unique qualitifcations for the job</li>
			<li class="checkbox-list__item">Specific ways you'll contribute to your new company or team</li>
			<li class="checkbox-list__item">Re-state the company's offer to be sure you're on the same page</li>
			<li class="checkbox-list__item">State your counteroffer amount</li>
			<li class="checkbox-list__item">Confirm your next meeting</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Once you deliver your counteroffer, the company will discuss it internally to determine how much they can accomodate your request. Then you'll usually have a quick chat I call The Final Discussion. The sample salary negotiation script below will help you negotiate starting salary in The Final Discussion.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="container container--widened">
    <h2 class='section-heading section-heading--with-line'>3. Your salary negotiation script for negotiating starting salary</h2>
    <p><strong>Once you've countered, the company will probably respond with something between your job offer and your counteroffer.</strong> That's your negotiation window. Your goal is to maximize your salary within that window.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="container container--grid">

      <p>In this example the company has made <em class='u-highlight'>an offer of <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span></em>, and <em class='u-highlight'>you have countered at <em class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>. Your <em class='u-highlight'>negotiation window is now <span class="original-offer">$50,000</span>–<span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></em>. This sample salary negotiation script is your plan for hashing out the final details of your compensation package in the Final Discussion by <em>first</em> maximizing your base salary and <em>then</em> negotiating for additional benefits.</p>

    <p>(Your Minimum Acceptable Salary is the underlined row.)</p>

      <h3><u><span class="counteroffer-number">$56,000</span></u> (Counter)</h3>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
	<li><strong>$55,000</strong> - Sounds good, when do I start?</li>
	<li><strong>$54,000</strong> - $55,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
	<li><strong>$53,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</li>
	<li><u><strong>$52,000</strong> - $54,000 and I'm on board!  - (1) Extra vacation (2) Work from home (3) Reimburse office</u></li>
	<li><strong>$51,000</strong> - I can't accept less than $52,000.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><u><span class="original-offer">$50,000</span></u> (Offer)</h3>

    <p><strong>How to use this script</strong></p>

    <p>The company will discuss your counter internally and determine how much they can pay you. Then you will often have a quick phone call with the recruiter or hiring manager to determine your final salary and other benefits.</p>

    <p>When the company responds to your counter, <em class='u-highlight'>use this script to maximize your starting salary and benefits</em>. For each step, if they accept your proposal, then you're finished. If they don't accept your proposal, go to the next step.</p>
    
    <ol>
			<li><strong>Use the first statement as your first response.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $55,000, you'll say, "Sounds good, when do I start?" If the company comes back with $54,000, you'll say, "$55,000 and I'm on board!"
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>If they do not accept your first response, take the current salary as your base and request your highest-priority benefit.</strong> In this example, if the company comes back with $53,000, then you say "If you can do $54,000, I'm on board!"</p>
			  <p>If they stick with $53,000, then you would say, "I understand the best you can do is $53,000 and you can't come up to $54,000. If you can do $53,000 and offer an extra week of paid vacation each year, then I'm on board."</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>If they do not accept your highest-priority benefit, then you move on to your second-priority benefit.</strong> To continue our example, you would say, "We're at $53,000 and you're unable to offer an extra week of paid vacation. But if you can allow me to work remotely from home two days a week, I'm on board!"
			</li>
			<li><strong>If they do not accept your second-priority benefit, you move on to your third-priority benefit.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Regardless of whether they accept your response, then you're finished. You have maximized your base salary and maximized your benefits as well.</p>
