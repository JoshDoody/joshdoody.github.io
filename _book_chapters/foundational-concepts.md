This part of the book is very short and will only take a few minutes to read, but it covers some foundational concepts that will give you a clearer lens through which to view the rest of the book. "How companies manage their salary structures" not only gives you a quick survey of commonly used terminology, but also gives you a clear picture of how salaries are managed and determined behind the scenes. 

"How to estimate your market value" gives you a three-phase approach to estimating your market value by looking at your industry, your geographic region, and within your own company.

Both chapters will come in handy repeatedly throughout the book, so I encourage you to take a few minutes to read through them and refer back to them later on.
