	<p>You have an interview scheduled for tomorrow morning, and you meant to prepare—you really did!—but life just got in the way. So you kept putting it off and putting it off, and now you have 12 hours before your first interview for a job you really want.</p>

	<p>Your mind starts spinning, wondering what to expect. How do you prepare? What if this is a great opportunity and you botch this phone call?</p>

	<p>So you start Googling things like "Sample interview questions" and "Should I give my salary requirements in an interview". The top results are all books, long blog articles, massive interview guides, but there's no <em>time</em> to read all that!</p>

	<p>You just want to get through this first call, and you can read a book later on.</p>
