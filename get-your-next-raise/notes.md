### What you'll accomplish in this lesson

The most important thing you can do to get your next raise is _start now_. If you're like most people, you're here because you're stuck. Maybe you feel you’re underpaid or undervalued. You know you do good work, but your salary hasn't kept up with your contributions. So here you are. Stuck.

This lesson—this entire _course_—will walk you through a proven process to get your next raise and get un-stuck.

We'll end with a look at the email template that you will use to build and document your case as we go.
