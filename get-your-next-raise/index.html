	<p>Every Monday you start a new work week. You check your email, review your calendar, and plan for all your big meetings. Then you have a quiet moment and that same old thought creeps in:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>What's next?</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>You've had that thought every week for <em>months</em>, and every week you find the same answer:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>I'll figure it out next week.</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>Then you go back to checking your email, reviewing your calendar, and getting ready for all those meetings. The same emails. The same schedule. The same meetings. The same job. The same paycheck. It's all the same.</p>

	<h2 class='u-center'>How many weeks has it been?</h2>
	
	<p>How many weeks has it been since you first thought, "What's next?" All those weeks with a smaller paycheck than you could've gotten.</p>
		
	<p>What if you could go back in time to that first Monday when this thought first crept in and <em>do something about it</em> right then? Where would you be right now?</p>
	
	<p>There are three possibilities—all of them are good for your long-term career:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>You could already be there</strong>, at the next level <em>doing</em> your new job and <em>collecting</em> that bigger paycheck—$50 a week, $100 a week, $200 a week, or more.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be executing a plan with a clear timeline</strong> that you and your manager put together to get you to the next level. You would be making progress, not sitting still.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be looking ahead to better opportunities</strong> if the raise or promotion you feel you've earned simply isn't available to you at your current company.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>But you haven't even <em>started</em> doing something about it yet. So could be leaving money on the table every week while your career stagnates.</p>
		
	<h2 class='u-center'>Why haven't you started?</h2>
	
	<p>That's the question, isn't it? If you're literally leaving money on the table every time you get a paycheck, then what's holding you back?</p>
	
	<p>Maybe you don't know <em>where</em> to start or <em>what</em> to do. "I want a raise." or "I want a promotion." isn't a plan, it's a dream. But you don't need a dream, you need a plan.</p>
	
	<h2 class='u-center'>This is your plan</h2>
	<p>The <em>Get Your Next Raise</em> process for getting a raise is simple. But <em>knowing</em> the process and <em>doing</em> the process are two different things. If you just keep putting it off and waiting until later, you may never follow through.</p>
	<p>Waiting just six months to get a $5,000 raise will cost you $2,500—that's <em>ten times</em> the cost of this course!</p>
	
	<p>Thousands of people have read my best selling book <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, and I've worked with many people 1-on-1 to walk them through this process with great results. Now I'm offering the same process as self-paced course!</p>

	<h2 class='u-center'>Common questions and answers</h2>
	<p><strong>How long does this take?</strong></p>
	<p>Each lesson should take 30–60 minutes. Your total time invested will probably be about 4–5 hours.</p>
	<p>The course is self-paced, so you can move through the lessons as quickly or leisurely as you like. You could easily complete the course in a day or two, or take your time over a few weeks.</p>
		
	<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
	<p>Here's a high-level summary of the cadence for each of the six lessons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Starts with an email overview of the lesson and a link to the lesson page</li>
		<li>Watch the lesson video lesson (5 to 10 minutes)</li>
		<li>Complete the lesson's action items using the included templates and worksheets</li>
		<li>Move on to the next lesson when you're ready</li>
	</ol>

	<p><strong>What does "self-paced" mean?</strong></p>
