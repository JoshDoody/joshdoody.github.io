	<p>Once John realized it had been way too long since he had gotten a raise, it was all he could think about.</p>

	<p>Not only did he know he was underpaid, but he could practically see the dollars flying out the window with every passing paycheck. </p>

	<p>The worst part was that he knew he could never get those dollars back—once they were gone, they were gone.</p>

	<p>And his smaller-than-it-should-be paycheck was costing him valuable <em>time</em> as well. It was taking too long to pay off his student loans and the interest was piling up. It was taking him <em>forever</em> to save up for a down payment on a house while he watched housing prices go higher and higher.</p>

	<p>He knew he deserved a raise but he wasn't sure where to start.</p>

	<p>Should he talk to his manager? (Yes.)</p>

	<p>Should he ask for a specific amount? (Yes.)</p>

	<p>Should he brag about his accomplishments? (Yes.)</p>

		<p>With the right plan, you can finally able to <em>do something</em> about that too-small paycheck and start making real progress on your financial and professional goals, just like John did.</p>

		<p>The key is that you need to make it <em>super easy</em> for your manager to understand exactly what you deserve and communicate that to the higher-ups in your company.</p>

		<p>The easier you make it for your manager to communicate with the higher-ups, the sooner you'll get the raise you deserve.</p>

		<p><em>But how?!</em></p>

		<p>Based on my experience as a hiring manager, I will show you exactly how to determine what you <em>should</em> be paid so you know what to ask for, and you'll learn how to demonstrate that you deserve a raise based on the valuable work you do.</p>

		<p>I will show you how to make sure you have everything you need to talk to your manager about your raise, ho to schedule that meeting, and how to put everything in writing after you talk so it's <em>easy</em> for your manager to approve your request and pass it along to the higher-ups.</p>
