	<!--p>You optimize every system you can, tweaking each line until its just right, but are you doing the same for your salary? Most devs I know are underpaid because they either don't know their value or they don't know where to start when it comes to asking for a raise or promotion. This 30-day class will help you know your value and plan for your next raise or promotion to optimize your salary.</p-->

	<p>Every Monday you start a new work week. You check your email, review your calendar, and plan for all your big meetings. Then you have a quiet moment and that same old thought creeps in:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>What's next?</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>You've had that thought every week for <em>months</em>, and every week you find the same answer:</p>
	
	<p><strong><em>I'll figure it out next week.</em></strong></p>
	
	<p>Then you go back to checking your email, reviewing your calendar, and getting ready for all those meetings. The same emails. The same schedule. The same meetings. The same job. The same paycheck. It's all the same.</p>

	<h2>How many weeks has it been?</h2>
	
	<p>How many weeks has it been since you first thought, "What's next?" All those weeks with a smaller paycheck than you could've gotten.</p>
		
	<p>What if you could go back in time to that first Monday when this thought first crept in and <em>do something about it</em> right then? Where would you be right now?</p>
	
	<p>There are three possibilities—all of them are good for your long-term career:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>You could already be there</strong>, at the next level <em>doing</em> your new job and <em>collecting</em> that bigger paycheck—$50 a week, $100 a week, $200 a week, or more.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be executing a plan with a clear timeline</strong> that you and your manager put together to get you to the next level. You would be making progress, not sitting still.</li>
		<li><strong>You could be looking ahead to better opportunities</strong> if the raise or promotion you feel you've earned simply isn't available to you at your current company.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>But you haven't even <em>started</em> doing something about it yet. So could be leaving money on the table every week while your career stagnates.</p>
		
	<h2>Why haven't you started?</h2>
	
	<p>That's the question, isn't it? If you're literally leaving money on the table every time you get a paycheck, then what's holding you back?</p>
	
	<p>Maybe you don't know <em>where</em> to start or <em>what</em> to do. "I want a raise." or "I want a promotion." isn't a plan, it's a dream. But you don't need a dream, you need a plan.</p>
	
	<h2>This is your plan</h2>
	<p>The <em>Get Your Next Raise</em> process for getting a raise is simple. But <em>knowing</em> the process and <em>doing</em> the process are two different things. If you just keep putting it off and waiting until later, you may never follow through.</p>
	<p>Waiting just six months to get a $5,000 raise will cost you $2,500—that's <em>ten times</em> the cost of this course!</p>
	
	<p>Hundreds of people have read my best selling book <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em>, and I've worked with many people 1-on-1 to walk them through this process with great results. Now I'm offering the same process as self-paced course for only <s>$247</s> $197 when you pre-order.</p>

	<h2>Common questions and answers</h2>
	<p><strong>How long does this take?</strong></p>
	<p>Each lesson should take 30–60 minutes. Your total time invested will probably be about 4–5 hours.</p>
	<p>The course is self-paced, so you can move through the lessons as quickly or leisurely as you like. You could easily complete the course in a day or two, or take your time over a few weeks.</p>
		
	<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
	<p>Here's a high-level summary of the cadence for each of the six lessons:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Starts with an email overview of the lesson and a link to the lesson page</li>
		<li>Watch the lesson video lesson (5 to 10 minutes)</li>
		<li>Complete the lesson's action items using the included templates and worksheets</li>
		<li>Get my feedback or input on your progress</li>
		<li>Move on to the next lesson when you're ready</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Each lesson has a video lesson to define your goals for that lesson and cover the background and details you need to complete the lesson's action items.</p>
	<p>Then you'll complete the lesson's action items, ask me any questions you have, and get my feedback on your progress if you like.</p>
	<p>Once you're comfortable with that lesson and have completed the action items, you will move to the next lesson when you're ready or you'll be automatically moved to the next lesson after one week.</p>
	
	<p><strong>What does "self-paced" mean?</strong></p>
	<p>You can move as quickly or slowly as you like, and the course will help you keep moving. You will always be able to request the next lesson whenever you're ready, so if you want to cruise through the entire course in one sitting, you can!</p>
	<p>If you want to pace yourself, ask questions, and get my feedback as you go, you can do that too. I'll email you a few days after you begin the lesson to see how things are going and encourage you to keep moving. After a week, you'll automatically get the next lesson so you don't fall behind.</p>
