      <p><strong>Salary negotiation can be intimidating.</strong> There’s a lot on the line and every situation is unique. Plus, there are so many questions that it can feel overwhelming.</p>
      <ul class="question-list">
				<li class="question-list__item">Should you negotiate your salary?</li>
				<li class="question-list__item">What if the company retracts your job offer?</li>
				<li class="question-list__item">Are you paid what you’re worth?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It can be easy to just throw your hands up in frustration, but then <em class='u-highlight'>you could be leaving many thousands of dollars on the table</em>.</p>

      <h2 class='section-heading header--centered section-heading--with-line'>The most common salary negotiation mistake? Not negotiating at all.</h2>
		</div>
    <div class="container container--normal">
			<p>Ashley was interviewing for a new consulting opportunity at a software company. Her old company was going through a significant reorganization, and she was looking for a new opportunity in a more stable working environment. <strong>She was even willing to accept a lateral move in pay</strong> to get out of the old company and into a new one. She wasn't planning to negotiate if they made her an offer that matched her current salary.</p>
			<p>We scheduled a time to talk and I asked her some questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>"What is your market value?"</strong> Quite a bit higher than her current pay.</li>
				<li><strong>"How do you stack up against other consultants in your industry?"</strong> She was one of the most experienced consultants in the industry.</li>
				<li><strong>"How badly does this new company need your expertise?"</strong> They desperately needed her specific skillset and experience.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>She was in a very strong negotiating position, but didn't even plan to negotiate if they could meet her current salary! With a little bit of coaching, she decided to negotiate rather than accepting a lateral move. The result? <em class='u-highlight'>She made an additional $15,000 in base salary by negotiating her job offer.</em></p>

      <h2 class='section-heading header--centered section-heading--with-line'>This simple method will earn you thousands of dollars</h2>
		</div>
    <div class="container container--normal">
			<p>The best part? You can use this method <em>over and over</em> throughout your career when you change jobs <em>and</em> you can use it at your current job. It's easy and repeatable.</p>
			<p>If you could negotiate a $5,000 increase, you would make $5,000 more that first year. And you would make $5,000 the next year, and the next year, and the next year. <em class='u-highlight'>Over 20 years, that $5,000 salary increase would be worth more than $100,000.</em> That’s a lot of money to leave on the table out of frustration or fear.</p>

			<p><strong>What if I don’t need <em>Fearless Salary Negotiation</em> right now?</strong> Remember that example above where you negotiated $5,000 more in base salary and that added up to more than $100,000 over the next 20 years of your career? If you wait just one year, then that same $5,000 is only worth $95,000 over the next 20 years. Wait two years and that same $5,000 increase is only worth $90,000 over the next 20 years. <em class='u-highlight'>The sooner you start negotiating your salary like a pro, the more money you will make over the course of your career.</em></p>
			<p><strong>I don’t have time for this right now.</strong> That’s not a question! But I’ll answer it anyway. ;) <em class='u-highlight'>You can get through the entire course in less than an hour.</em> There's no fluff, only the strategy and tacctics you need to ace your next interview.</p>
